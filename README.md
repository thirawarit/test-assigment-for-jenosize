1.  Create your virtual environment. Activate the venv and install dependent libraries.
```bash
python3.10 -m venv .venv # Optional to change your venv name (".venv")
source .venv/bin/activate # You must change ".venv" here also, if you changed it previously.
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**NOTE:** If you need to exit from this venv, you can use:
```bash
deactivate
```
