However, in today's era, Asia is also making significant strides in technology. Recently, a startup from China is shaking up the AI industry with innovative solutions at an affordable price. That startup is **\"DeepSeek AI,\" **which is quickly becoming a symbol of limitless potential and capabilities in an era where China is facing challenges from trade sanctions.\n\n\n\n# What is DeepSeek AI?\n\nDeepSeek is a small startup based in Hangzhou, China, founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, a Chinese businessman and expert in hedge funds and AI. Liang's goal is to develop technology that can transform the way AI systems operate in the future. With a clear vision to create AI capable of processing data efficiently while reducing operational costs, DeepSeek AI has quickly gained attention from investors and users in the global AI technology industry as a promising new AI from China.\n\u00a0\n# What Makes DeepSeek AI Stand Out from Other Chatbots on the Market?\n\nDeepSeek AI is not only a highly efficient AI technology but also boasts several features that differentiate this Chinese AI from other models on the market. These features not only help reduce development and operational costs but also significantly enhance data processing efficiency. Some of the key highlights include:\n\n## Use of Mixture of Experts (MoE) Technology\nOne of DeepSeek AI's standout features is its use of Mixture of Experts (MoE) technology, which improves the performance of AI systems. MoE selects the most suitable expert for each task, reducing costs and increasing processing speed compared to AI technologies that use a single model for data processing.\n## \n## Collaboration with AMD\nDeepSeek has partnered with AMD, a leading hardware manufacturer, to utilize Instinct GPUs and the ROCM (Radeon Open Compute) software, which are not subject to U.S. export restrictions. This collaboration enables DeepSeek to process data more quickly and efficiently without concerns about restrictions from the U.S. government.\n\n## DeepSeek Coder \u2013 A Free Coding Tool\nAnother feature that sets this Chinese AI apart is DeepSeek Coder, a tool that allows users to write code more easily and efficiently. Available for free as an open-source platform, it provides developers worldwide with convenient access to this powerful tool, promoting global collaboration and innovation.\n\n## DeepSeek LLM (Large Language Model)\nDeepSeek has developed DeepSeek LLM, a large language model capable of communicating with users naturally in human language. This model enhances the system's ability to understand and accurately respond to user queries, whether they are general questions or more complex inquiries.\n\n## DeepSeek R1 \u2013 A High-Performance AI Model\nAnother key innovation from DeepSeek is DeepSeek R1, a high-performance AI model that operates at one-tenth the cost of ChatGPT. This model is designed to process data quickly and accurately while being cost-effective. DeepSeek R1 supports various applications, from chatbot interactions to business integrations, making it a versatile AI solution for multiple industries.\n\n\ufeff\n\n## How Much Does DeepSeek AI Cost?\n\nOne of the key strengths that make DeepSeek AI stand out in various industries is its cost-effectiveness, offering a much lower price compared to other AI services on the market, particularly OpenAI, one of the leading AI technology providers.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, DeepSeek R1, DeepSeek\u2019s high-performance AI model, operates at a significantly lower cost compared to competitors. The pricing for DeepSeek R1 is:\n\n\n$0.55 per 1 million input tokens\n$2.19 per 1 million output tokens\n\nIn comparison, OpenAI charges:\n\n$15 per 1 million input tokens\n$60 per 1 million output tokens\n\nThis substantial price difference makes DeepSeek AI an attractive option for businesses looking to reduce AI development and operational costs.\n\nAdditionally, DeepSeek currently offers some features for free, allowing users to explore and experience its AI technology without financial commitments.\n**\u00a0**\n## Limitations of DeepSeek AI\n\nWhile DeepSeek AI offers high processing efficiency at a lower cost, there are still some limitations to consider that could affect its widespread adoption and growth:\n\n## Data Security Challenges\nData security is a top concern when using AI technology, especially when handling personal or confidential data. One limitation of DeepSeek is that it may not fully guarantee data security in every aspect. Addressing risks related to data breaches or misuse of information remains a challenge that DeepSeek must overcome to build greater trust among users.\n\n## Preventing AI Misuse\nAI technology is powerful in generating accurate and fast content, but it can be dangerous if misused\u2014for example, in creating fake news or manipulated information that deceives people or causes societal harm. DeepSeek is currently working on tools to detect and prevent AI misuse, but controlling AI applications in all aspects remains a significant challenge.\n\n## Competing with Tech Giants\nDespite its advantages in affordability and efficiency, DeepSeek still faces fierce competition from larger companies like OpenAI and Google AI, which have greater resources, continuous investment in research, and advanced technology development. Competing with these tech giants remains an ongoing challenge for DeepSeek as it strives to maintain its competitive edge in the global AI market.\n\u00a0\nDespite its challenges, DeepSeek AI has the potential to be a formidable competitor in the global AI industry\u2014especially in terms of its affordable pricing and cutting-edge technology. If the company can effectively address its security and competitive challenges, its future looks promising and full of opportunities.\n\nBeyond making waves in the AI industry, DeepSeek is also reshaping how people access AI technology, proving that the AI landscape is still open for innovation and relentless competition.\nIf you're interested in integrating AI technology into your business, consider consulting a tech agency specializing in AI innovations to ensure a strong foundation for your future in the AI-driven world."}]}

Consumers can be influenced to change their behavior through something as simple as design\u2014no coercion, no explicit guidance, just the creative shaping of an environment that fosters conversions!\n\nBehavioral design is a groundbreaking concept set to revolutionize innovation. It sits at the intersection of psychology, design, and technology, transforming how we think about influencing society. Let\u2019s dive deeper into how behavioral design is connected to marketing and how it can drive impactful change.\n\n\n\n# What is Behavioral Design?\n\nBehavioral design, literally translated as \u201cdesigning behavior,\u201d closely aligns with its practical application in marketing. It refers to the strategic and effective design of experiences, products, or services aimed at influencing and changing the behavior of target audiences.\n\nThis concept integrates knowledge from multiple disciplines\u2014psychology, design, and technology\u2014to create measurable outcomes. Behavioral design is not just about aesthetics; it\u2019s about crafting purposeful environments that guide actions and drive desired results.\n\n# The Three Key Components of Behavioral Design\n\n## 1. Behavioral Psychology\nUnderstanding the decision-making mechanisms of the target audience is fundamental to Behavioral design. Marketers need to thoroughly analyze both the motivations driving actions and the barriers preventing behavioral change. By identifying why people do or don\u2019t engage in certain behaviors, marketers can design more precise and effective solutions.\n## \n## 2. Experience Design\nEnvironments and touchpoints have a significant influence on user behavior. Effective design should create experiences with the following characteristics:\n\nFacilitate desired actions.\nSimplify usability and reduce complexity.\nProvide motivation through appropriate rewards, such as promotions or discounts.\nFeature clear and intuitive UI/UX design.\n\n## 3. Data Analytics\nIn the era of digital transformation, leveraging big data and machine learning is essential for tracking and measuring behavioral changes. These tools enable marketers to analyze and improve customer experiences while predicting future behaviors and market trends. By using data-driven insights, strategies can be refined for maximum impact.\n\u00a0\n## Key Techniques in Behavioral Design\n## \n## 1. Nudge Theory\nThis theory focuses on subtly \u201cnudging\u201d or stimulating the thoughts, feelings, or actions of the target audience through clever design that guides decision-making without forcing or limiting user choices. For example, placing healthy food prominently in a cafeteria encourages people to choose healthier options simply by increasing their visibility.\n## \n## 2. Gamification\nThis involves incorporating game mechanics and elements into non-game contexts to foster engagement and motivation. Examples include point systems, unlocking achievements, competing with others, or earning rewards. Gamification is widely used in designing digital products and services because it effectively drives user participation.\n## \n## 3. Choice Architecture\nThis concept emphasizes designing how options are presented to users, aiming to help them make better decisions. It is based on the understanding that human decision-making is not always rational and is often influenced by the presentation of information and contextual factors. Marketers must carefully consider how to structure and present choices to optimize outcomes.\n\u00a0\n## Pros and Cons of Behavioral Design\n\n## Pros of Behavioral Design\n\n**Enhances behavioral change: **By leveraging proven psychological principles, Behavioral Design naturally and effectively influences human behavior.\n**Creates user-centric experiences: **Designing with real user needs and behaviors in mind leads to higher satisfaction and fosters long-term engagement.\n**Measurable and systematic improvement: **The use of data and in-depth analysis allows for systematic measurement and continuous refinement of outcomes.\n**Cost-effective in the long run: **Proper design reduces the need for costly corrections, increases user retention, and strengthens brand loyalty, ultimately saving resources over time.\n\n## Cons of Behavioral Design\n\n**Risk of perceived manipulation: **Some consumers may feel their behavior is being controlled or overly influenced. Transparency in design is essential to mitigate this concern.\n**Resource and time intensive: **Behavioral design requires significant investment in research and data analysis during the development phase, though it often proves worthwhile over time.\n**Uncertain and time-dependent outcomes: **Human behavior is complex and unpredictable, often influenced by uncontrollable external factors. Achieving results through behavioral design requires patience and consistent effort.\n\n\ufeff\n\n## Behavioral Design in Real-World Business Examples\n\n\n**Spotify**,** **a standout example of behavioral design in the music streaming industry. The platform uses algorithms to analyze individual user behavior, such as which songs are played, skipped, or added to playlists. This data is then processed to create a personalized music experience, encouraging users to continue engaging with the app based on their preferences and listening habits.\n\n**Duolingo**, a language-learning platform, effectively uses behavioral design to keep users engaged in their lessons like a game. The platform employs a streak system that motivates learners to return daily to maintain their learning streak. It also breaks lessons into small, manageable units that can be completed quickly, making users feel a sense of progress and accomplishment, which helps sustain their learning habit.\n\u00a0\nAs a new-generation marketer, always remember that we're not just designing products or services; we are designing the experiences and consumer behaviors that drive business results. However, when applying behavioral design to marketing, it is crucial to consider ethics, respect privacy, and uphold human rights to demonstrate sincerity towards consumers. This approach is essential for achieving long-term success in the marketing world in a sustainable manner."}]}

It has become a vital technique every brand must master to win customers' hearts. But how can you ensure your brand is not just another option for consumers but becomes the one and only choice they think of?\u00a0\n\nLet\u2019s explore the meaning, strategies, and practical steps to achieve effective brand positioning. Together, we\u2019ll uncover how to craft a differentiation strategy that makes your brand incomparable, no matter how fierce the competition!\n\n\n\n# What is Brand Positioning?\n\n**Brand positioning refe****rs to the process of defining the image or perception that a brand wants customers to \u201csee\u201d or \u201cremember.\u201d** The goal is to differentiate the brand, build brand awareness, and lay the foundation for a strong relationship between the brand and its target audience.\n\n# But why is brand positioning important?\nEffective brand positioning strategy is akin to painting a clear and distinct image in the minds of consumers. This not only helps the brand stand out from competitors but also fosters a deeper emotional connection with customers.\n\u00a0\n# The Effective Brand Positioning Process\nDeveloping effective brand positioning strategy is a complex process requiring a deep understanding of five key dimensions. These will enable your brand to build awareness and foster meaningful connections with your target audience.\n\n## 1. Know Your Brand DNA\nAccurate brand positioning process begins with thoroughly understanding your brand\u2019s essence. This foundation ensures credible and powerful communication with consumers. Key elements to define include:\n\n\n**Mission: **The organization\u2019s core purpose beyond profitability.\n**Vision: **Long-term goals and the direction the brand aspires to achieve.\n**Core Values: **Principles and beliefs forming the foundation of the organization.\n**Brand Personality: U**nique emotions and tones reflected in the brand\u2019s communication.\n\n## 2. Know Your Competitors\nSystematic competitor analysis is essential to establish a unique brand positioning. By understanding competitors, you can uncover opportunities for differentiation and competitive advantage. Marketers should thoroughly assess:\n\n\nCurrent market positioning of competitors.\nStrengths and weaknesses of competitors.\nUntapped market gaps and unmet consumer needs.\n\n## 3. Know Your Customers\nUnderstanding your target audience is the cornerstone of the brand positioning process. It enables you to design meaningful experiences and tailored communication. Customer analysis should cover:\n\n\n**Demographics: **Age, income, education, occupation.\n**Psychographics: **Values, beliefs, attitudes.\n**Behavioral Patterns: **Spending habits, purchasing decisions.\n**Needs and Expectations: **Pain points, hidden desires, and aspirations.\n\n## 4. Be Unique\nDifferentiating your brand is the heart of effective brand positioning. A unique identity sets your brand apart, securing a permanent place in consumers\u2019 minds. Focus on:\n\n\nOffering unparalleled value.\nEstablishing a clear and memorable stance.\nInnovating or adopting unique approaches that competitors can\u2019t replicate.\n\n## 5. Communicate Consistently\nConsistency in communication across all channels is key to building trust and reinforcing a clear brand image. This ensures your brand remains top-of-mind for consumers over time. Effective communication involves:\n\n\nStrategic marketing communication.\nLeveraging digital media effectively.\nEngaging with customers at every touchpoint.\nDesigning memorable and impactful customer experiences.\n\u00a0\n## How to Create Brand Positioning That Outshines Competitors\n\n## Conduct a Comprehensive Market Analysis\nThe foundation of superior brand positioning strategy lies in identifying unmet customer needs that competitors have overlooked. Marketers must approach this systematically, starting with an in-depth study of consumer behavior. From there, identify neglected market gaps and latent needs\u2014those hidden desires customers might not yet articulate\u2014and address them effectively.\n\n## Leverage Emotional Appeal\nIn today\u2019s marketplace, success is no longer solely determined by physical attributes of a product but also by the emotional and sensory connections a brand creates. Businesses must seamlessly align their brand with customer values or craft shared emotional experiences. Demonstrating a deep understanding of customers' profound needs fosters loyalty and resonance.\n\n## Develop Product Differentiation\nIf your product mirrors others in the market, even the best brand positioning strategy will fall short. Innovation and differentiation are crucial. Identify the unique strengths of your product, create distinctive features that competitors cannot replicate, and focus on addressing specific customer pain points effectively.\n\n## Craft Memorable Storytelling\nEngaging storytelling builds deep emotional connections with customers. Whether it\u2019s sharing meaningful and inspiring narratives, linking brand experiences to the personal lives of customers, or creating a distinctive identity that competitors can\u2019t imitate, compelling stories leave a lasting impression and enhance brand loyalty.\n\n\n\n## Global Brands with Clear Brand Positioning Examples\n\n\n**Coca-Cola** positions itself as more than just a beverage; it\u2019s a symbol of happiness, friendship, and togetherness. This is evident in the brand\u2019s campaigns, which often focus on fostering shared emotions and positive experiences.\n**Tesla** goes beyond being an automobile manufacturer. The brand establishes itself as a leader in innovation aimed at transforming the world. By leveraging cutting-edge technology to address environmental issues, Tesla emphasizes its commitment to creating a sustainable future.\n**Apple** excels at brand positioning by emphasizing minimalist design, innovation, and seamless user experience. The brand doesn\u2019t just sell electronic devices; it sells a lifestyle and a mindset centered on creativity and individuality.\n\u00a0\nIn conclusion, brand positioning is not just a marketing strategy but a holistic approach that combines understanding your brand's identity, creating differentiation, and building strong connections with your audience. When executed effectively, it doesn\u2019t just drive sales but also nurtures long-term relationships, turning customers into true brand advocates.\n\nAre you ready to elevate your brand to a position that commands attention?\n\nChoose the right path, plan strategically, and outpace your competitors.

Marketing Tips for This Group\n\n\"Glamorous,\" is quickly becoming a trend among consumers who value luxurious, premium, and unique products and services. For brands, this means the focus shouldn't be merely on selling ordinary goods or services but on delivering experiences that reflect the identity and ultimate aspirations of these target audiences. What they seek are symbols of social status, success, and an elevated lifestyle.\n\n\n\n## Who is the Luxury Consumer or Luxumer?\n**Luxumer, o****r luxury consumer, refe****rs to a group of consumers who prioritize luxury in every aspect of their lives. **It\u2019s not just about purchasing high-end brand-name products but also embracing a lifestyle defined by exclusivity and sophistication.

Make the Brand More Than a Product \u2013 Be a Statement\nTo appeal to luxury consumers, brands must go beyond simply offering products or services and instead create meaningful value. This involves storytelling that reflects the identity and taste of consumers. For example, sharing a brand's rich history, the craftsmanship behind production, or a unique business philosophy can transform a product into a symbol of personal expression and refined taste.\n\n## 2. Deliver Exclusive Experiences\nLuxury consumers seek exceptional, tailored experiences. Providing exclusivity is crucial, whether through VIP events, personalized services, or limited-edition collections. Creating a sense of belonging through membership programs or exclusive perks is another highly effective strategy to foster brand loyalty.\n\n## 3. Communicate Luxury Through Visuals and Branding\nEvery interaction with the brand should exude luxury. From visual identity design, photography, and layout to the choice of colors, fonts, and graphic elements, every detail must convey premium quality and attention to detail. Communication should balance sophistication and modernity, ensuring the brand\u2019s image resonates with its audience.\n\n## 4. Targeted and Insightful Communication\nUnderstanding luxumers\u2019 insights deeply is essential. Study their behaviors, desires, and decision-making motivations to craft brand messages that align with their lifestyles and needs. This approach allows brands to address both functional and emotional needs effectively, ensuring the message resonates on every level.\n\n## 5. Digital-First but Human-Centric\nWhile luxury consumers are adept at using technology, they still value personal interaction.

Or when searching for information on the internet, Google is often the first choice that comes to mind. This is the power of strong **\"brand awareness\" **that has allowed these brands to dominate the hearts of consumers for a long time.\n\nHowever, in today's world, building brand awareness has become more challenging than ever, with the increasing variety of communication channels, rapidly changing consumer behavior, and fierce competition in the marketing world. Brands must understand what brand awareness strategy entails and the various levels that need to be gradually climbed.\n\n\n\n# Let\u2019s take a moment to revisit - What is Brand Awareness?\n\n**Brand awareness refers to the le****vel of a consumer's ability to recognize and identify a brand through various elements**, such as its name, logo, slogan, or unique characteristics that stand out.\n\nThe reason businesses need to prioritize brand awareness strategy is because brand recognition acts as a bridge between consumers and the brand. Through creating a lasting impression and positive memories, it builds a strong long-term relationship. This recognition can occur through various channels, such as seeing advertisements, hearing word-of-mouth, or personal experiences with the products and services.\n\u00a0\n# What are the Levels of Brand Awareness?\n\nBrand awareness does not occur instantly; it develops in different stages. These stages can be divided into four main levels:\n\n## Level 1: Zero Awareness - The Starting Point for Every Brand\nAt this initial stage, consumers are unaware of the brand. It is like being a stranger in the market, a significant challenge for new brands that need to create awareness of their existence. The focus is on introducing the brand to consumers through various channels, and planning marketing efforts to create initial recognition.\n\nLevel 2: Brand Recognition - Recognize or Recall the Brand When Seen\nAt this level of brand awareness, consumers begin to recognize the brand when they see or hear it, though they may not automatically think of it on their own. Recognition might include:\n\n\nThe ability to remember the logo, color, or unique design of the brand.\nFamiliarity with seeing the product on store shelves.\nAssociating the brand with a certain category of products or services.\n\n## Level 3: Brand Recall - The Brand That Comes to Mind When Needed\nAt this level, consumers can recall the brand without needing external cues such as products, logos, or advertisements. This is a deeper form of memory recall that is embedded in long-term memory. Consumers can identify the brand when thinking about a certain product category.\n\n\nThe brand often appears in the list of options consumers consider when purchasing.\nConsumers understand the brand\u2019s value and unique qualities.\n\n## Level 4: Top of Mind - The First Brand in the Consumer\u2019s Mind\nBeing the number one brand in the consumer\u2019s mind is the pinnacle of brand awareness that every business strives to reach. When a brand achieves this level, it means the business has become the representative of the product or service category by default.\n\n\nThe brand is the first that comes to mind in its product category.\nIt earns trust and loyalty from consumers.\nIt has a high influence on purchasing decisions.\nIt can set market direction and holds significant business leverage.\n\n\n\n## What are the Strategies for Building Brand Awareness Campaign?\n\n## \ufeffFind a Clear Brand Position\nEstablishing a clear brand position is essential for building a strong brand foundation. Consider the following components:\n\n\n**Market and Competitor Analysis:** Study market gaps that are not being addressed, analyze competitors' strengths and weaknesses, and identify opportunities to differentiate your brand.\n**Understand the Target Audience: **Study consumer behavior and needs, understand the challenges they face, and identify the values that are important to them.\n**Define the Core Brand Values: **Create a distinctive and unique position, set clear missions and visions, and develop values that align with market needs.\n\n## Build a Strong Brand Identity\nBrand Identity must effectively communicate the brand\u2019s personality and values. This includes:\n\n\n**Visual Elements: **Create an easily recognizable logo that conveys meaning, unique color schemes, and a design style that aligns with the brand\u2019s values.\n**Communication Elements: **Define the brand's tone of voice and personality in communication, craft memorable and catchy slogans, and establish a unique language and presentation style.\n\n## Tell the Brand Story\nEffective storytelling can help create a deeper emotional connection with consumers. Key factors for a compelling brand story include:\n\n\n**Good Story Components: **The brand\u2019s origins and inspiration, the values and beliefs the brand holds, and the brand\u2019s mission to its customers and society.\n**Emotional Connection: **Share experiences and successes, showcase impactful customer stories, or inspire through storytelling.\n\n## Use Diverse Marketing Techniques\nYou don\u2019t have to rely on just one technique in marketing; you can combine different marketing tools to reach your target audience more effectively. These techniques include:\n\n\n**Public Relations (PR): **Create interesting news, organize engaging events, or build strong relationships with media outlets.\n**SEO: **Develop content that satisfies both readers and search engines, optimize your website to rank in search results, and build quality backlinks.\n**Social Media Content: **Create engaging content that encourages sharing, use various presentation formats, and consistently engage with your followers.\n\u00a0\nRemember that creating a successful brand awareness strategy requires a blend of creativity, consistency, and a deep understanding of consumer behavior.

Tangibility: Creating a Strong, Tangible Impression\nTangibility refers to the physical elements of service that customers can perceive through their senses\u2014such as the environment, equipment, employee attire, or communication materials. These elements shape first impressions and influence perceived service quality.\nTo improve tangibility, businesses can:\n\n\nDesign a clean, organized, and visually appealing service space.\nStandardize professional uniforms for staff.\nDevelop high-quality marketing materials for a seamless customer experience.\n\n## 3. Responsiveness: Quick Responses to Meet Customer Needs\nIn a fast-paced world, the ability to promptly address customer needs is critical to quality service.

Methods include:\n\n\nCustomer satisfaction surveys.\nAnalysis of complaints.\nEmployee performance evaluations.\n\u00a0\nElevating service quality goes beyond merely meeting customer needs; it\u2019s about creating a unique value that cannot be replicated.

By understanding these roles, businesses can tailor their sales strategies to align with each role effectively, but where consumer behavior is becoming increasingly complex, many businesses are opting to collaborate with a digital agency that specializes in in-depth consumer analysis. This collaboration enables the development of precise and effective marketing strategies that align with the multifaceted roles of modern consumers.\n\n\n\n# What are Consumer Buying Roles?\n\n**Consumer buying roles refer to**** the various roles played by individuals involved in the decision-making process for purchasing a product or service.** In any given purchase, multiple people may participate, each with distinct roles.

At the same time, we also saw the rapid growth of brands that had a deep understanding of the buying cycle, or the customer decision-making process. The key difference between these businesses lies in their ability to \u201cread\u201d and \u201caddress\u201d consumer needs at every stage of the decision-making process.\n\nLet\u2019s get to know the buying cycle in retail businesses, along with practical techniques you can apply to drive success. Whether you run a small shop or a large retail organization, these insights can be tailored to suit your needs.\n\n\n\n# Understanding the 5 Buying Cycle Stages in Customer Decision-Making\n\n## 1. Awareness Stage: The Beginning of Every Purchase\nThis is the initial stage where customers are unaware of your brand or product. Building brand awareness is crucial at this stage. Strategies to achieve this include:\n\n\n**Content Marketing: **Address customer pain points, e.g., a furniture business could create articles on modern home decoration ideas.\n**Social Media Campaigns: **Leverage platforms to boost brand visibility, e.g., a beauty clinic posting skincare tips for glowing skin.\n**SEO Optimization: **Ensure your products or services are easily searchable on search engines\n\n## 2. Consideration Stage: Evaluating Options\nAt this stage, customers know about your brand and are exploring their options. They seek more information to compare alternatives before deciding. Strategies to enhance customer confidence include:\n\n\n**Product Comparisons: **Highlight pros and cons, e.g., an electronics store creating graphics comparing specifications and prices of popular air conditioner models.\n**Reviews and Testimonials: **Showcase feedback from existing customers to build trust in your brand\u2019s quality.\n**Educational Content: **Provide detailed articles, guides, or demonstration videos about your products, usage tips, and maintenance.\n\n## 3. Decision Stage: The Critical Moment\nHere, customers have all the information they need and are ready to make a purchase decision. Brands should focus on motivating immediate purchases through:\n\n\n**Special Offers:** Provide discounts, exclusive packages, or free gifts.\n**Creating Urgency:** Encourage customers to act fast with tactics like limited stock alerts or time-sensitive promotions.\n\n## 4. Purchase Stage: Ensuring a Smooth Transaction\nOnce customers have all the necessary information and decide to buy, the next step is to provide a seamless and pleasant purchasing experience. Key strategies include:\n\n\n**Variety of Secure Payment Options: **Offer payment methods such as credit cards, PayPal, bank transfers, or cash on delivery.\n**Simple and Intuitive Ordering Process:** Avoid complex steps to make ordering straightforward.\n**Clear Order Confirmation and Tracking: **Provide clear purchase confirmation and allow customers to track their order status at any time.\n\n## 5. Post-Purchase Stage: Building Lasting Impressions\nThe final stage of the buying cycle focuses on after-sales service to ensure satisfaction and foster loyalty. Effective strategies include:\n\n\n**Efficient Customer Support:** Provide 24/7 assistance to address inquiries or handle complaints.\n**Post-Purchase Follow-Ups:** Reach out to customers to check their satisfaction with the product or service.\n**Attractive Loyalty Programs: **Offer rewards like point accumulation or discounts on future purchases.\n\n\n\n## Applying the Buying Cycle in Retail Businesses\n\nRetail businesses must understand and effectively apply the buying cycle concept. In today\u2019s competitive landscape, customers have numerous options and can easily change their minds. Retailers need to attract and retain customers for long-term brand loyalty.\n\n## Use Data Analytics to Understand Customer Behavior\nUsing data analytics helps businesses gain deeper insights into customer behavior. This enables the creation of targeted marketing and sales strategies tailored to each stage of the buying cycle, ensuring efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n## Deliver Personalized Experiences with AI\nDeveloping personalized experiences through AI technology allows businesses to cater to the unique needs of each customer. From product discovery and comparison to the decision-making process, AI enhances customer engagement by offering tailored recommendations and solutions.\n\n## Implement an Effective Omnichannel Strategy\nAn omnichannel strategy is crucial for providing a seamless and cohesive customer experience across all touchpoints\u2014whether online, mobile, or in-store. By integrating these channels, businesses can create a unified journey that meets customer expectations.\n\u00a0\nSuccess in retail goes beyond offering quality products. It hinges on understanding and addressing customer needs at the buying cycle stages. The more deeply you understand your customers, the greater your business\u2019s growth potential."}]}

The answer lies in their marketing strategy. It\u2019s not just about having a great strategy; it must also align with the business model.\n\nThe secret behind these successful brands is **STP Marketing****\u2014Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning**. If you're wondering how to analyze STP, it all starts with understanding the market, dividing it into segments, targeting the right audience, and positioning your brand effectively to meet consumer needs. Partnering with an agency that offers digital consulting services is essential to understanding the market landscape and adapting to rapidly changing consumer behavior.\n\n\n\n# What is STP Marketing, and Why is it Important?\n\n**STP Marketing is a strategic**** marketing approach comprising three core components: Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning.** The STP strategy helps businesses identify the right audience, tailor their offerings, and create a competitive edge. If you\u2019re asking how to analyze STP, it\u2019s important to break down each component and determine where your business fits into the broader market dynamics.\n\nThe importance of STP strategy lies in its ability to:\n\nProvide deep insights into customer needs.\nEnhance resource efficiency.\nMaximize customer satisfaction.\nBuild sustainable competitive advantages.\n\u00a0\n# Understanding the Components of STP Marketing\n\nNow, we know the STP meaning that it\u2019s short for Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning. So, let\u2019s explore the 3 key steps in STP marketing!\n\n## 1. Segmentation \u2013 Dividing the Market\nSegmentation is the foundational step in the STP strategy, aiming to group consumers based on shared characteristics or behaviors. This helps businesses tailor their products and services to meet specific needs effectively. Common segmentation criteria include:\n\n### Demographic\n\n**Age: **Teens, working adults, or seniors.\n**Gender:** Male, female, or non-binary.\n**Income: **Low, middle, or high income.\n**Education:** High school, bachelor\u2019s degree, or higher.\n**Occupation: **Employees, entrepreneurs, or freelancers.\n\n### Geographic\n\n**Residence: **Urban, suburban, or rural.\n**Climate: **Hot, cold, or tropical.\n**Population density: **High, medium, or low density.\n\n### Psychographic\n\n**Lifestyle:** Travel enthusiasts, sports lovers, or art admirers.\n**Personality:** Outgoing, introverted, or adventurous.\n**Values:** Eco-conscious, family-oriented, or tech-savvy.\n**Attitudes:** Optimistic, stability-seeking, or challenge-driven.\n\n### Behavioral\n**Purchase behavior:** Occasional or frequent buyers.\n\n**Usage frequency: **Daily, weekly, or monthly users.\n**Brand loyalty: **Loyal to a single brand or switches brands.\n**Benefits sought: **High quality, affordability, or excellent service.\n\n### 2. Targeting \u2013 Selecting the Right Target Market\nAfter identifying market segments, the next step in the STP marketing strategy is to select the most suitable target audience for your business. This process involves evaluating several key factors:\n\n### Market Size\n\n**Potential customers: **How large or small is the market?\n**Market growth rate: **Does the segment show potential for expansion?\n**Future opportunities: **Can the needs of this group be met in the long term?\n\n### Competitive Advantage\n\n**Brand strengths: **What unique advantages does your brand offer?\n**Available resources: **Does your business have adequate manpower, technology, or funding?\n**Specialized expertise: **Can your brand deliver something competitors cannot?\n\n### Business Feasibility\n\n**Cost to reach the audience: **What resources and budget are required?\n**Expected return on investment: **Will the investment in this market be worthwhile?\n**Market sustainability: **Is this market segment stable in the long run?\n\n### 3. Positioning \u2013 Establishing a Distinct Brand Image\nPositioning in the STP marketing process is about shaping the brand's image and perception in the minds of consumers to stand out in a competitive market. This step includes the following key elements:\n\n### Unique Selling Proposition (USP)\n\n**Value delivered: **What specific benefits do customers gain from your product or service?\n**Differentiation: **How does your brand stand out from competitors?\n**Distinctive features: **Highlight unique attributes like exclusive design, innovation, or exceptional experiences.\n\n### Brand Communication\n\n**Key message: **What is the primary message you want customers to remember about your brand?\n**Communication channels: **Use platforms like social media, websites, or email to reach your audience.\n**Presentation style: **Deliver your message effectively through visuals, videos, or clear and impactful text.\n\n\n\n### STP Marketing Examples in Global Business\n\n### 1. Fashion Business - UNIQLO\n\n### Segmentation\n\nWorking professionals looking for quality, comfortable, and simple clothing at an affordable price.\nStudents and young adults who appreciate minimalist fashion.\nFamilies in need of everyday clothing.\n\n### Targeting\n\nFocus on urban dwellers aged 20-40 with a middle to high income.\nPrioritize consumers who value quality of life and cost-effectiveness.\nTarget individuals looking for clothing that combines fashion and functionality.\n\n### Positioning\n\nA clothing brand that offers innovative fabric technology at an affordable price.\nLifeWear that fits every lifestyle.\nSimple design with high quality, suitable for any occasion.\n\n### 2. Technology Business - Samsung\n\n### Segmentation\n\nSmartphone users seeking comprehensive features.\nConsumers interested in smart home appliances.\nBusinesses requiring advanced technological solutions.\n\n### Targeting\n\nYoung adults who love innovation but consider value for money.\nFamilies aiming to modernize their homes with Smart Home technology.\nEntrepreneurs in need of end-to-end technology systems.\n\n### Positioning\n\nA leader in innovation that meets every need.\nA technology brand seamlessly integrating all devices.\nOffering a wide range of products at various price points to cater to every consumer segment.\n\u00a0\nMake sure your brand is not just one of the options, but the only choice consumers desire. If you have a deep understanding of how to analyze STP, your brand can easily become an industry leader. Consulting with digital consulting experts could be a crucial step to make your STP strategy more accurate and effective.\n\nDon't wait any longer\u2014take action now and prove to the world that your brand is ready to capture consumers' hearts!"}]}

It\u2019s about engaging with customers in a natural, deep, and multi-dimensional way that goes far beyond what you might expect.\n\nBelow are** 5 common misconceptions about customer journey** that can derail even the best marketing strategies. Let\u2019s see which ones you\u2019ve encountered\u2014or believed\u2014yourself.\n\n\n\n# **What Is Customer Journey?**\n\nBefore we dive into the misconceptions, let\u2019s revisit the basics: what is customer journey?\n\nThe customer journey refers to the complete experience a customer has with a brand\u2014from the first moment of awareness, through the purchase decision, and ideally into brand loyalty. It encompasses every touchpoint across both online and offline channels, including seeing an ad, browsing a website, trying a sample, or even speaking with a customer service rep.\n\nUnderstanding the customer journey is fundamental to modern marketing\u2014especially as consumer behaviors grow more complex and diverse than ever before.\n\u00a0\n# **5 Misconceptions About Customer Journey You Might Not Know**\n\n## **1. The Simpler the Journey, the Better **\nMany brands mistakenly believe that the customer journey should be as short and simple as possible to encourage quick decision-making. However, oversimplifying the process can backfire\u2014especially when it removes critical information that helps customers feel confident.\n\nTake health-conscious consumers as an example. They often need detailed product information, expert recommendations, and peer reviews. Stripping this down for the sake of \"simplicity\" could actually make their decision harder.\n\n## **2. All Customers Follow the Same Journey**\nOne of the most common misconceptions about customer journey is thinking everyone follows the same path. In reality, customers buying the same product may do so for completely different reasons. One might purchase quickly due to familiarity, while another may need extensive reviews or compare value and brand image.\n\nAssuming a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d journey can cause your brand to miss opportunities to engage specific customer segments effectively.\n\n## **3. Repeat Customers Want Everything to Stay the Same **\nEven with repeat purchases\u2014like soap, toothpaste, or coffee\u2014customers still crave variety and freshness. Brands often assume consistency means avoiding change altogether, but subtle upgrades or seasonal specials can add excitement and maintain engagement.\n\nConsistency is key\u2014but so is keeping things interesting to sustain long-term interest.\n\n## **4. The Journey Ends at Purchase**\nMany marketers think the customer journey ends once a sale is made. On the contrary, this is often when the most important part begins. Exceptional post-purchase service can lead to repeat business, loyalty, and word-of-mouth referrals.\n\nExtending the journey to include post-purchase touchpoints is essential for increasing lifetime customer value.\n\n## **5. One Journey Works for All Seasons**\nUsing the same customer journey strategy year-round\u2014without adapting to seasonal trends, economic conditions, or cultural shifts\u2014can make your marketing feel out of touch. For instance, during economic downturns, customers may prioritize value over luxury, so focusing on premium branding may not resonate.\n\nCustomer journeys must evolve with real-time insights and context to stay relevant and impactful.\n\n\n\n## **Use the Customer Journey Matrix to Make Better Business Decisions**\n\nTo create more effective customer journey, many brands now use a customer journey matrix, which classifies journeys along two key axes: complexity (easy\u2013hard) and predictability (predictable\u2013unpredictable). This results in four journey types:\u00a0\n\n## **1. Routine \u2013 Easy and Predictable**\nFor everyday purchases like groceries or monthly services, predictable behavior allows for strategies like membership programs, loyalty programs, and auto-renewals.\u00a0\n\n## **2. Joyride \u2013 Easy but Unpredictable**\nProducts driven by emotion or impulse\u2014such as gifts or snacks\u2014benefit from emotional marketing, fun content, and flash sales that tap into spur-of-the-moment decision-making.\u00a0\n\n## **3. Trek \u2013 Hard but Predictable**\nBig-ticket or long-term commitments like insurance, education, or real estate require planning. Recommended tactics include informative content, free consultations, and trial access.\u00a0\n\n## **4. Odyssey \u2013 Hard and Unpredictable**\nThese journeys are typical of inspiration-based decisions, such as social impact startups or creative ventures. Successful strategies include brand storytelling, purpose-driven messaging, and community building.\n\nBy understanding these differences, brands can see that designing a customer journey isn\u2019t about making everything easy\u2014it\u2019s about tailoring experiences to fit each audience, goal, and context.\n\n## **Rethink the Journey: Build What Customers Really Need**\n\nThe customer journey matrix allows you to account for emotional drivers, behavioral patterns, and shifting expectations\u2014factors that a one-size-fits-all model can easily overlook. Relying on a single journey framework can make your messaging feel flat and limit your ability to build meaningful relationships.\n\nIf you're looking to create a professional customer journey strategy that truly fits your audience and drives long-term results, our team at Jenosize is here to help.

One of the most effective ways to achieve this is through Single Customer View (SCV)\u2014a unified approach that consolidates customer data from all touchpoints into one comprehensive profile. With a complete view of each customer, brands can deliver more personalized, consistent, and meaningful experiences across channels.\n\n\n\n# What Is Single Customer View (SCV)?\n\n**SCV stands for Single Customer View, which refers to the process of aggregating customer data from various sources**\u2014such as websites, mobile apps, social media, email, point-of-sale (POS) systems, and customer service teams\u2014and integrating it into a centralized system.\nWhen all data points are connected, businesses gain a 360-degree perspective of each customer\u2019s behaviors, preferences, and interactions. This holistic view enables more informed decision-making, precise targeting, and tailored marketing strategies.\n\u00a0\n# Benefits of Single Customer View\n\nImplementing an effective SCV can transform how your brand interacts with customers. Below are the top benefits of Single Customer View for modern businesses:\n\n## Enhance Personalization Efforts\nUp-to-date, comprehensive customer data allows brands to craft more relevant messages, offers, and campaigns. This reduces the feeling of being \"sold to\" and increases the likelihood of conversions.\n\n## Improve Omnichannel Customer Experiences\nBy unifying data across all platforms, customers receive seamless and consistent service, no matter which channel they use to engage with your brand.\n## \n## Increase Accuracy in Data Analysis and Forecasting\nWith clean, centralized data, analysts can more clearly identify customer behavior patterns and emerging trends. This results in more accurate forecasting and better-informed strategic decisions.\n\n## Reduce Costs and Operational Inefficiencies\nSCV helps eliminate duplicate or fragmented data, enabling sales, marketing, and customer service teams to operate more efficiently\u2014saving time, reducing errors, and cutting unnecessary costs.\n\n\n\n## How to Create a Single Customer View\nWhile the concept of SCV may sound straightforward, building a complete and effective customer view requires the right tools, technologies, and strategic planning. Here's how to create a Single Customer View in your organization:\n\n## 1. Connect Data Across Platforms for a Clear Customer Picture\nCreating an SCV begins with collecting data from every customer touchpoint\u2014website, mobile apps, social media channels, email systems, CRM platforms, and in-store POS systems. Though dispersed across different platforms, each data point provides valuable insights into customer behavior.\n\nBy accurately linking these data sets, brands can visualize the customer journey in real time and respond with tailored personalization. Tools like Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) and APIs can also streamline the integration process, ensuring all data is funneled into a single, centralized system without duplication or loss.\n\n## 2. Standardize and Cleanse Data\nOnce data is collected, the next challenge lies in harmonizing various formats and ensuring completeness. Different systems often record data inconsistently\u2014mismatched name spellings, duplicate emails, or missing details.\n\nKey steps in this phase include:\n\n**Data Cleansing:** Removing errors and duplicates.\n**Data Standardization: **Unifying formats (e.g., dates, geographic details).\n**Data Deduplication: **Merging repeated records into one accurate entry.\n\nWithout these processes, the data cannot be effectively analyzed or used to build reliable customer profiles.\n\n## 3. Build 360-Degree Customer Profiles\nAfter cleansing and standardizing your data, the next step is to create a 360-degree customer profile. These profiles consolidate demographic information (e.g., age, gender, location), behavioral data (e.g., site visits, purchase history), and customer interactions (e.g., chat history, support tickets) into one cohesive view.\n\nThese comprehensive profiles not only empower marketing teams to personalize campaigns more effectively but also enable seamless collaboration across departments\u2014from sales and customer service to product development.\n\n## 4. Use Data to Drive Strategy and Customer Engagement\nWith well-organized data at your fingertips, your business can now refine its strategic efforts. SCV plays a crucial role in:\n\n\n**Personalization: **Using real customer insights to deliver relevant content, offers, and communications across the right channels.\n**Customer Journey Mapping: **Identifying where each customer is in the buying process to deliver timely, tailored content.\n**Marketing Automation:** Automatically triggering personalized campaigns at optimal times to enhance the customer experience.\n\u00a0\n\nA Single Customer View is more than just a data management strategy\u2014it\u2019s a powerful tool that allows businesses to understand and connect with their customers on a deeper level. By integrating and analyzing data from all touchpoints, companies can sharpen their marketing and sales strategies, enhance operational efficiency, and deliver exceptional customer experiences.\n\nIn 2025 and beyond, brands looking to thrive in a competitive digital landscape must invest in building an SCV framework. Whether through in-house data architecture or partnerships with a consulting company, establishing a long-term Single Customer View solution is essential for sustainable business growth."}]}

The major causes of the growing amount of e-waste today include:\n\n\n**Rapid technological development: **Technological advancements lead to the constant release of new products into the market, driving consumers to upgrade their devices to keep up with modern trends.\n**Consumer culture: **In today's society, there is a strong value placed on using new and modern products, resulting in frequent electronic upgrades, even when the older devices are still functional.\n**Shorter product lifespans:** Some manufacturers design products with shorter lifespans to boost sales and encourage customers to regularly switch to newer models.\n**Difficulty in repairs: **Modern electronic devices are often designed in a complex manner, making them difficult to repair or replace parts. As a result, consumers tend to purchase new devices rather than repair the old ones.\n**Lack of efficient management systems: **Many countries, including Thailand, still lack proper e-waste recycling and management systems, leading to electronic waste being mixed with general waste.\n\u00a0\n# What Impact Does E-waste Have on the World?\n\n## Environmental Impact\nE-waste is a serious environmental problem because electronic devices contain many hazardous chemicals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and flame retardants. When discarded, these substances can contaminate the soil and water, negatively affecting ecosystems and living organisms. Additionally, improper burning of e-waste releases air pollutants, toxic substances, and greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, further worsening air quality.\n\n## Impact on Human Health\nExposure to toxic substances from e-waste, whether directly or through environmental contamination, has long-term adverse effects on human health. For instance, lead impacts the nervous system and brain development, especially in children. Mercury damages the central nervous system, kidneys, and liver, while cadmium increases the risk of cancer and harms the circulatory system.\n\n## Loss of Resources and Biodiversity\nImproperly managed e-waste leads to the loss of valuable resources such as gold, silver, copper, and rare earth minerals, which could otherwise be recycled. Discarding e-waste without recycling requires the extraction of new resources, affecting ecosystems and biodiversity in mining areas.\n\n## Climate Change Contribution\nThe production of new electronic devices and improper disposal of e-waste contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and the release of harmful dioxins, playing a significant role in climate change.\n\n## Land Management Challenges\nThe rapid increase in e-waste poses land management challenges, particularly in developing countries, which often become the dumping grounds for e-waste from developed nations. A lack of proper space and management systems leads to open dumping or improper landfill practices, which harm the environment and the health of nearby communities.\n\n\ufeff\n\n## Business Strategies to Reduce Environmental Impact and Promote Sustainability\n\n## Sustainable Product Design\nBusinesses can help address the e-waste problem by focusing on sustainable product design, known as \"eco-design.\" This approach not only reduces e-waste but also enhances the brand image and meets the growing demand from environmentally-conscious consumers. Key principles include:\n\n\nDesigning products with longer lifespans.\nUsing eco-friendly and recyclable materials.\nMaking products easy to disassemble and repair.\nReducing the use of hazardous substances in the manufacturing process.\n\n## Take-back and E-waste Recycling Policies\nBusinesses can initiate take-back programs for old products, allowing them to be recycled or properly disposed of. This helps reduce the amount of e-waste entering the environment while building brand loyalty and recovering valuable materials. Examples include:\n\n\nOffering discounts on new products when customers return old devices.\nSetting up collection points for old electronics in stores or service centers.\nPartnering with certified recycling companies to efficiently manage e-waste.\n\n## Greening the Supply Chain\nManaging the supply chain to be more environmentally friendly is a key strategy for reducing e-waste, promoting sustainability, and cutting business costs. This can be achieved through the following steps:\n\n\nCollaborating with suppliers that have strong environmental policies and strictly adhere to environmental standards.\nPromoting the use of recycled materials in production to reduce reliance on new resources and minimize waste.\nDesigning packaging that uses less material while maintaining product protection, and choosing biodegradable materials.\n\n## Clean and Energy-efficient Operations\nAs e-waste becomes an increasingly severe environmental issue, simply managing electronic waste may no longer be enough. Switching to clean energy and improving energy efficiency can help reduce e-waste in the future. For example:\n\n\nConsider installing solar panels or wind turbines to generate electricity for internal use.\nInstall energy-efficient lighting, upgrade insulation, and use high-efficiency air conditioning systems.\nChoose energy-saving computers, printers, and other office equipment with energy efficiency labels.\nImplement automated control systems to optimize energy usage based on actual demand.\nIf generating clean energy in-house is not feasible, consider purchasing electricity from renewable energy sources through utility programs.\n\u00a0\nConducting business with consideration for e-waste and sustainability is not only a social and environmental responsibility but also a way to create new business opportunities. This includes developing eco-friendly products, building a positive brand image, and reducing long-term costs through efficient resource use. Such practices prepare businesses to better handle increasingly stringent environmental regulations in the future, while also meeting the demands of modern consumers who prioritize environmentally friendly products and services."}]}

The concept of regenerative business has emerged amidst a new awakening in the global business community, based on the belief that businesses should not only be \"non-harmful\" but must step up to become \"drivers of positive change\" that help restore and heal ecosystems, society, and the economy simultaneously.\n\n\n\n# What is Regenerative Business? From Sustainability to Industry Revitalization\n\nMoving beyond the traditional focus on merely reducing environmental harm, a new business model called \"Regenerative\" is gaining more attention. This approach takes sustainability a step further by focusing on the restoration of ecosystems and resources, aiming to bring them back to a state of abundance.\n\nRegenerative business refers to a way of doing business that goes beyond simply reducing, preventing, or mitigating negative impacts. Its goal is to create positive effects by restoring value to the environment and ecosystems, as well as actively contributing to solving social issues. This represents a significant step forward in business practices.\n\u00a0\n# What is the Difference Between Regenerative Business and Sustainable Business?\n\nThe key difference between Sustainable and Regenerative Business is that sustainable businesses focus on \"avoiding harm\" or \"reducing negative impacts,\" while regenerative businesses focus on \"creating positive impacts\" and \"actively restoring systems\" in a tangible way.\n\u00a0\n# What are the Key Principles of Regenerative Business?\n\n## Holistic System Thinking\nThis principle involves viewing problems and solutions in a holistic way by considering the interconnectedness of different systems\u2014environmental, economic, and social. It emphasizes understanding and responding to the complexity of these systems, rather than just addressing isolated issues.\n\n## Co-evolution\nBusiness is seen as a way to create shared value between organizations, society, and the environment. Organizations and systems develop together in harmony, rather than in isolation or competition.\n\n## Living Innovation\nThe focus is on creating innovations that are flexible, adaptable, and continuously evolving. These innovations should align with and reinforce the living systems around them, rather than being disconnected from their environment.\n\n## Regenerative Cycles\nThe core of regenerative business is designing processes that circulate continuously. For example, reusing waste or by-products to create a complete natural cycle, without causing long-term loss or negative impacts.\n\n## Long-term Resilience\nThe focus is on continuous development to ensure long-term sustainability, including the ability to adapt to and manage future changes.\n\u00a0\n## Advantages of Regenerative Business\n\n## Creating Sustainable Positive Value\nNot only does it reduce negative impacts, but it also creates positive effects and restores ecosystems to a better state. Additionally, it fosters development that sustains natural systems and society in the long run.\n\n## Competitive Advantage\nIt helps build a strong brand image and trust with consumers, organizations, and investors, while also enabling the creation of new innovations and added value for products and services.\n\n## Adaptability to Change\nRegenerative businesses are highly flexible and capable of adapting to challenges and changes in the future.\n\n## Fostering Long-term Collaboration and Development\nIt promotes sustainable development that aligns and supports the business, society, and environment, encouraging long-term cooperation and interdependence.\n\n## Disadvantages of Regenerative Business\n\n## Investment Challenges\nTransitioning to a regenerative business model requires significant resources and investment, along with time to adjust and develop processes.\n\n## Difficulty in Measuring Outcomes\nPerformance metrics are often unclear and challenging to assess, and success tends to manifest over the long term, not immediately.\n\n## Resistance from Traditional Organizations and Systems\nThere may be misunderstandings and resistance from some stakeholders, and the business may need to change its organizational mindset and culture.\n\n\n\n## Regenerative Business and Real-World Examples of Application\n\n\n**Patagonia**, a manufacturer of outdoor gear and clothing, designs its products to be reusable by using recycled materials and eco-friendly resources. The company also supports movements to protect the environment and nature.\n**IKEA, **a producer and retailer of furniture and home goods, aims to use 100% renewable or recycled materials by 2030. Additionally, it designs products that can be disassembled and reused, offering repair services and promoting the reuse of old furniture.\n**Interface, **a manufacturer of carpets and flooring materials, aims to become \"Carbon negative\" by 2040. Currently, the company incorporates waste materials and recycled resources in its production, and designs its products to be reusable.\n\u00a0\nIn summary, regenerative business is a revolutionary approach to business that is essential for survival in the 21st century. Organizations that understand and adapt quickly will lead in the newmarket era, where consumers are increasingly focused on the positive impact on society and the environment. Transitioning to a regenerative business model may seem challenging, but it presents a great opportunity to gain a competitive advantage while contributing to building a better future for everyone."}]}

It is now a strategy that enhances competitive advantage in the global market. One key tool playing a vital role in this effort is **carbon credit,** which enables businesses to effectively and systematically manage their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nFurthermore, many organizations are seeking partnerships with a digital agency that specialize in crafting strategies and communicating sustainability narratives to the new generation of consumers. This approach helps raise awareness and understanding of the value of environmentally-friendly business practices.\n\n\n\n# What is Carbon Credit?\n\n**Carbon credit is a unit re****presenting the amount of greenhouse gas emissions reduced. One carbon credit equals the reduction of one ton of carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) or other greenhouse gases. **The carbon credit system is designed to create economic incentives for businesses and industries to work together in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This is achieved through mechanisms that enable the buying and selling of carbon credits in the carbon market.\n\n# What is the Importance of Carbon Credit in a Business Context?\n\n## Meeting the Demands of Environmentally-Conscious Consumers\nAs consumers today place greater importance on environmental issues, they are more inclined to support brands that demonstrate genuine responsibility towards the environment. Investing in the carbon credit market not only helps businesses reduce their environmental impact but also enhances their brand image and credibility.\n\n## Compliance with International Regulations and Standards\nMany countries have implemented laws and regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Businesses looking to expand into international markets must comply with these standards. Participating in the carbon credit market is one way to showcase responsibility and adherence to global requirements.\n## \n## Creating Business Opportunities with Carbon Credits\nThe carbon credit market provides businesses with opportunities to generate revenue by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Organizations that exceed their reduction targets can sell their surplus carbon credits in the carbon market, creating additional income streams beyond their core operations.\n\u00a0\n## Guidelines for Conducting a Carbon Credit Business\n\n## Assessing Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nThe first step in entering the carbon credit business is to evaluate an organization\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions, both direct and indirect.

This includes understanding the processes, measurement, evaluation, and the business benefits it offers. Consequently, the development of the carbon credit market in Thailand has not progressed as effectively as it could.\n\n## Carbon Credit Market Infrastructure\nThe carbon credit business in Thailand is still in its early stages of development due to a lack of essential infrastructure. This includes the absence of standardized carbon credit trading systems, mechanisms for verification and certification, and integration with international carbon markets. Additionally, there are challenges in setting appropriate and fair carbon credit pricing that accommodates all stakeholders.\n\n## Government Support\nWhile the government has policies to promote greenhouse gas reduction, practical support remains limited. Challenges include insufficient tax incentives, financial assistance, and clear regulatory frameworks. This lack of concrete support diminishes the private sector\u2019s motivation to invest in carbon credit initiatives.\n\n\n\n## Strategies to Promote the Use of Carbon Credit in Thai Businesses\n\n## Providing Knowledge and Raising Awareness\nDeveloping the carbon credit market in Thailand requires fostering a clear understanding among business operators. This includes foundational principles, business benefits, and operational guidelines. Organizing training sessions, seminars, and disseminating information through various channels can help enhance knowledge and broaden awareness across industries.\n\n## Developing a Domestic Carbon Credit Market\nAn efficient carbon market relies on collaboration among all sectors. Key steps include establishing a transparent carbon credit trading system, creating verification and certification standards, and connecting with international carbon markets. Additionally, developing financial products related to carbon credits can enhance market liquidity and attractiveness.\n\n## Supporting Greenhouse Gas Reduction Projects\nThe government should consider implementing more tangible support measures, such as offering tax incentives, providing financial assistance for greenhouse gas reduction projects, or setting clear emissions reduction targets. These measures would encourage private sector participation in the carbon credit market and accelerate its growth.\n\u00a0\nAdopting carbon credits in business not only helps mitigate environmental impact but also serves as a tool to gain market advantage, enhance brand value, and meet the expectations of sustainability-conscious consumers and investors. If you\u2019re seeking guidance on sustainability communication, an experienced digital agency can help craft strategies and design messaging that resonates with your target audience. Start today to prepare for a future where sustainability takes center stage globally."}]}

Among the initiatives driving this change, **\"plant-based food\"**** **stands out as a business that creates opportunities while gradually reshaping the world. It's not just the way people consume that has evolved\u2014this industry is revolutionizing perceptions of food and its impact on the environment.\n\nSo, it\u2019s safe to say that a plant-based food diet, or food derived from plants, is not just another passing trend like so many others. It is, in fact, \"the next big thing\" that everyone needs to keep an eye on!\n\n\n\n# What is Plant-Based Food, and Why is it Important?\n\n**Plant-based food refers to food made primaril****y from plant-based ingredients, **designed and processed to replicate the taste, texture, protein content, and nutritional value of animal-based foods. Examples include plant-based meat zero burgers, steaks made from pea protein, and even plant-based ice cream.\n\nThanks to advancements in modern food technology, scientists and food experts have developed innovative production methods to create plant-based food that not only mimics the flavor but also closely resembles the structure and texture of animal-based products. This breakthrough offers a sustainable and appealing alternative to traditional meat, addressing both consumer demand and environmental challenges.\n\u00a0\n# Is Plant-Based Food Good for You?\n\nPlant-based food diet is renowned for its exceptional nutritional value, being rich in vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber while low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Nutritionists also highlight that a regular plant-based diet can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases.\n\nHowever, if you are wondering , is plant-based food good for you? The answer is \u201cYes.\u201d And there are still more advantages of plant-based food that extend far beyond health. Here are some additional benefits:\n\n## Environmentally Friendly\nThe production of plant-based food has a significantly lower environmental impact compared to animal-based food. Studies reveal that producing plant-based food requires less water, emits fewer greenhouse gases, and uses agricultural land more efficiently, making it a sustainable choice for the planet.\n\n## Diverse and Creative Options\nContrary to the misconception that a plant-based food diet is bland and monotonous, modern culinary innovations and technology have transformed it into a versatile and exciting category. From pea-protein burgers that taste like beef to plant-based sausages and even cheese made from fermented nuts, these creative offerings showcase the incredible evolution of alternative foods. They effectively erase outdated perceptions, proving that plant-based diets can be both flavorful and diverse.\n\u00a0\n## The Benefits of Plant-Based Food for the Future of the World\n\nThe rise of plant-based food is not just about introducing plant-based diets; it represents a significant revolution with positive impacts on the future of humanity. Here\u2019s how:\n\n## Promoting Better Health for Modern Lifestyles\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced and stressful world, a plant-based food diet offers a practical solution for health-conscious living.

This is especially true for industries often perceived as \"villains\" in environmental destruction. However, even industries that seem contrary to the idea of sustainability can adapt and evolve just like other businesses. In this article, we will explore three industries currently facing sustainability challenges and reveal adaptation strategies that can help these businesses thrive in an era when consumers are increasingly focused on \"eco-friendliness.\"\n\n\n\n# 3 Industries that Seem Contrary to Sustainability Trends but Are Adapting\n## \n## 1. The Plastic Industry\nThe plastic industry is one of the most criticized for its environmental impact, including issues like plastic waste in the oceans, long degradation times, and the use of fossil resources in production. Despite the challenge of maintaining this industry in an increasingly environmentally conscious world, adaptation is not impossible.\n\n## Sustainability Adaptation Strategies for the Plastic Industry\n\n## Bioplastics\nBioplastics are made from agricultural materials such as corn, sugarcane, and cassava. They are biodegradable and decompose faster than conventional plastics, helping to reduce the amount of plastic waste in nature, especially in waterways and oceans. Additionally, using agricultural raw materials reduces reliance on fossil resources, which are limited and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Advanced Recycling\nChemical recycling is an innovation that reprocesses used plastics into raw materials without losing material quality, allowing for multiple reuse cycles. This method not only reduces plastic waste but also decreases energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from new plastic production. It also addresses complex plastic waste management issues, such as mixed plastics or plastics with other contaminants.\n\n## Design for Recycling\nHistorically, plastic product designs did not consider recycling processes. Today, the concept of design for recycling is gaining popularity. This involves improving product design to make recycling easier, thus reducing unnecessary plastic waste. Good design considers easy disassembly, minimizing the use of chemicals that may hinder recycling, and using 100% recyclable materials like monomaterial plastics.\n\n## Marine Degradable Plastics\nBeyond the issue of plastic waste accumulation in oceans, there are also microplastics that break off from regular plastics, affecting aquatic life. Therefore, developing plastics that can degrade in marine environments is an important goal. Such plastics help reduce plastic waste in water and maintain marine ecosystem balance amid the plastic pollution crisis.\n## \n## 2. The Textile and Fashion Industry\nWhen discussing industries that impact the environment, many people think of the textile and fashion industry. This includes concerns about water usage, chemical emissions, and waste generated from producing Fast Fashion garments, which consumers often wear only a few times before discarding. However, this industry can also adapt to a more sustainable model.\n\n## Sustainability Adaptation Strategies for the Textile and Fashion Industry\n\n## **Sustainable Materials**\nChoosing environmentally friendly materials is a crucial step towards sustainability in the textile and fashion industry. Increasingly popular materials include organic natural fibers such as organic cotton, hemp, and linen, which are grown without harmful chemicals and pesticides, reducing soil and water contamination. Additionally, recycled fibers, such as those made from PET plastic bottles, offer a promising alternative, helping to reduce plastic waste and the natural resources needed to produce new fibers.\n\n## Eco-Friendly Dyeing Processes\nDyeing in the textile industry is a resource-intensive process that uses large amounts of water and releases harmful chemicals into wastewater. However, more sustainable dyeing techniques are emerging, such as dry dyeing, which uses less water, and natural dyes that are biodegradable, reducing the release of toxic chemicals into water sources.\n\n## Circular Fashion\nOne popular approach is clothing rental, where consumers can rent garments for short periods instead of buying new ones. This reduces the accumulation of unused clothing in wardrobes. Additionally, buying second-hand clothes and recycling old garments are effective strategies. Recycling old clothes allows fibers to be reused and decreases the amount of clothing waste sent to landfills.\n\n## On-Demand Production\nFast Fashion typically involves mass production to meet market demand and rapidly changing fashion trends. The issue is that excess production often leads to unsold clothes being discarded or discounted, resulting in wasted resources and energy. On-demand manufacturing, which uses technology to produce garments based on actual orders, can address this issue. For example, 3D printing technology can produce custom clothing and reduce resource waste and greenhouse gas emissions from production and transportation processes.\n\n\n\n## 3. The Automotive Industry\nThe automotive industry is often viewed as contrary to sustainability principles due to the significant environmental impact associated with vehicle production and use. This includes fossil fuel consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste generated from end-of-life vehicles. However, like the previous two industries, the automotive sector can also adapt to environmental trends in surprising ways.\n## \n## Sustainability Adaptation Strategies for the Automotive Industry\n## \n## Electric Vehicles (EVs)\nThe most noticeable adaptation in recent times is the development of electric vehicles. EVs produce no greenhouse gas emissions during use, which helps reduce carbon dioxide emissions and air pollution. They also decrease reliance on fossil fuels, which are limited resources with environmental impacts.\n\n## Eco-Friendly Manufacturing\nThis includes using renewable energy in manufacturing facilities, reducing water and chemical usage in vehicle production, and increasing the use of recycled materials in vehicle components. These practices not only minimize environmental impacts but also can lower long-term production costs.\n\n## Hybrid Vehicles and Alternative Fuel Vehicles\nIn addition to electric vehicles, hybrid cars that combine fossil fuel engines with electric motors are an option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicles that use alternative fuels, such as hydrogen and biofuels, are also a promising direction for the automotive industry to meet sustainability demands.\n\nAlthough these industries face significant environmental challenges, there are pathways and opportunities for achieving sustainability. By integrating technological innovations, changing consumer behaviors, and supportive government policies, these industries can ultimately align with sustainable development principles."}]}

What was once a clothing brand that updated collections seasonally has transformed into one that introduces new products every week. What was once clothing designed for longevity has now become fashion made to cater to fleeting trends, as fashion trends change rapidly.\n\nHowever, while consumers are enjoying the convenience of shopping and affordable prices, the alarming mechanisms of fast fashion continue to relentlessly destroy the environment and society, like a ticking time bomb that is ready to impact future generations. \n\n\n\n# What is Fast Fashion and Why is it a Problem?\n\nFast fashion is a business model in the fashion industry that focuses on producing clothing in massive quantities, with the lowest possible costs and the fastest production speed, to meet the rapidly changing demands of consumers following fashion trends.\n\nThis business model has grown exponentially over the past decade, with major fast fashion brands such as Zara, H&M, UNIQLO, and Forever 21 leading the market. These brands offer new collections every week, or sometimes almost every day, instead of following the traditional seasonal collection cycle.\n\u00a0\n# The Shocking Truths About Fast Fashion\n# \n## The Enormous Production Volume That Seems Almost Impossible\nThe following statistics may leave you speechless: Every second, a quantity of clothing equivalent to one truckload is thrown into a landfill. This means that millions of clothing items are discarded every day, wasted. Even more shocking, some Fast Fashion brands are able to produce up to 52 new collections per year, or an average of one collection every week.\n\n## Fast Fashion\u2019s Impact on the Environment\nThe fashion industry has become one of the largest CO2 emitters in the world, ranking second only to the oil industry. Another alarming statistic is that producing a single t-shirt requires 2,700 liters of water, which is the same amount of drinking water a person needs over 2.5 years.\n\nEven more concerning, synthetic clothing produced by a fast fashion brand has become one of the largest sources of microplastics released into the oceans. Every time we do laundry, tiny plastic fibers are shed and enter the water system, eventually flowing into the seas. Fast fashion is therefore severely impacting marine ecosystems.\n\n## The Hidden Costs Behind \u201cAffordability\u201d\nWhen we think of fast fashion brands, the first thing that comes to mind is usually affordability. But did you know that fast fashion carries many hidden costs that we may overlook? These costs are not reflected in the price tags but are burdens that society and the environment have to bear.\n\n## Exploitation of Labor in Developing Countries With Wages Below the Standard\nBehind the cheap prices of fast fashion clothing lies the exploitation of labor in developing countries, where workers are paid well below a living wage. These workers must labor in dangerous conditions, long hours, and with inadequate benefits. Child labor is often found in the production chain, highlighting the hidden injustice.\n\n## Toxic Chemical Discharge into Water Sources from Dyeing Processes\nThe dyeing processes in the fast fashion industry are major contributors to water pollution. Many factories discharge wastewater containing harmful chemicals into natural water sources without proper treatment. These chemicals not only destroy aquatic ecosystems but also harm the health of nearby communities. Many areas in major garment-producing countries, such as China and Bangladesh, have rivers that are discolored from the dye runoff.\n\n## The Creation of Non-Biodegradable Waste from Synthetic Fibers\nCheap clothing is often made from synthetic fibers due to their lower cost compared to natural fibers. However, these fibers are made from plastic that cannot decompose naturally. When these clothes are discarded in landfills, they can remain there for hundreds of years. Additionally, during use, washing clothes made from synthetic fibers releases microplastics into the water system, which eventually contributes to ocean pollution, impacting the entire food chain.\n\n\n\n## What Can We Do as Entrepreneurs?\nAs fashion industry entrepreneurs, we can be part of the change towards creating a sustainable future by adjusting our business practices in several key ways:\n\n## Shifting Business Models to Sustainability\nChange needs to start from the foundation of the business by shifting from the \u201cfast production, cheap sales\u201d model of fast fashion to one that emphasizes sustainability, such as:\n\n\nDeveloping a Circular Economy system in the supply chain\nUsing recycled materials and environmentally friendly fabrics\nReducing production volume while increasing product quality and longevity\nCreating clothing rental systems or second-hand platforms\n\n## Creating Added Value Through Innovation\nInnovation is crucial for gaining a sustainable competitive edge, including:\n\n\nDeveloping water-and energy-efficient production technologies\nResearching and developing environmentally friendly materials\nUsing AI and Big Data to optimize production efficiency\nCreating a system to track sustainability throughout the supply chain\n\n## Adjusting Marketing Strategies\nCommunication and marketing must evolve to create new values within the fashion industry, reducing the popularity of fast fashion brands:\n\n\nBuilding a brand that focuses on sustainability and social responsibility\nProviding transparent information about sourcing and manufacturing processes\nPromoting garment care to extend the lifespan of products\nRaising awareness about the fast fashion\u2019s problem\n\n## Managing Long-term Risks\nLooking ahead and preparing for future challenges is essential, especially in the fashion industry, which is under pressure from multiple fronts. Businesses should:\n\n\nSystematically assess and manage environmental risks\nPrepare for increasingly stringent environmental regulations\nCollaborate with partners who share a vision for sustainability\nDevelop contingency plans for market shifts and crises\n\n## Investing in Human Resources\nDespite rapid advancements in technology and automation, human workers remain the heart of change in the fashion industry. Transitioning to sustainable fashion requires creativity, vision, and deep understanding, all of which are unique to humans. So, businesses should focus on:\n\n\nDeveloping sustainability skills and knowledge among employees\nCreating a fair and positive working environment\nPromoting an organizational culture that cares for the environment\nEncouraging employees to participate in developing sustainable innovations\n\u00a0\nThe transition to a sustainable fashion business requires significant investment in the early stages, but the long-term returns make it worthwhile, both in terms of financial performance and in building a strong brand. Brands that are slow to adapt or remain committed to the traditional fast fashion model risk losing market share to competitors who can pivot more quickly.\n\ufeff\nThe future of the fashion industry is no longer about the speed of production; it's about the intelligence in balancing profit, society, and the environment. Brands that can offer more than just beautiful clothes will lead the new market, where consumers increasingly prioritize sustainability each day."}]}

This shift is not only about complying with regulations but also about meeting consumer expectations. Implementing **ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) **principles is a key strategy that enables businesses to grow sustainably and remain competitive in the long term.\n\n\n\n# What is ESG, and Why is it Important for Businesses?\n\n**ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance**\u2014three key factors that organizations worldwide integrate into their operations to achieve sustainable growth. ESG initiatives focus on minimizing environmental impact, promoting corporate social responsibility, and ensuring strong governance practices. By adhering to ESG principles, businesses can enhance their competitiveness, reduce risks, and build trust with stakeholders.\n**\u00a0**\n# ESG and Business Transformation in the Modern Era\n\nWith increasing awareness of environmental sustainability, businesses\u2014ranging from SMEs and retail enterprises to government organizations\u2014must align with ESG frameworks. Among the three ESG pillars, the environmental aspect is particularly critical for business survival. Green technology and innovative solutions are at the core of this transition, helping businesses achieve long-term sustainability.\n\nGreen technology plays a crucial role in supporting ESG compliance by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving energy efficiency, and minimizing waste. By adopting environmental technology, businesses can lower operational costs while enhancing their sustainability efforts.\n\u00a0\n# 5 Green Technologies Transforming the World\n\n## 1. Clean Energy Solutions (Renewable Energy)\nClean energy solutions are a fundamental pillar of sustainable technology, helping reduce reliance on fossil fuels and promoting renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, and biomass power. Advances in solar panel efficiency and cost reduction have made renewable energy more accessible for businesses.\n\nFor SMEs and commercial enterprises, installing solar energy systems on rooftops can significantly cut electricity costs while reinforcing their commitment to sustainability.\n\n## 2. Battery Technology and Energy Storage Systems\nOne of the biggest challenges of renewable energy is its intermittency\u2014solar power is only available during the day, and wind power fluctuates. Energy storage systems help businesses store clean energy and utilize it 24/7.\n\nLithium-ion and solid-state batteries are becoming increasingly popular for both residential and industrial use. Companies looking to optimize energy consumption can invest in energy storage solutions to manage peak-hour electricity costs and ensure backup power during outages.\n\n## 3. Green Building Innovations\nThe construction industry is a major consumer of natural resources and a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Integrating green technology into construction can help reduce its environmental impact. Sustainable building innovations include:\n\n\nUsing eco-friendly materials such as recycled wood, low-carbon concrete, and natural insulation.\nDesigning energy-efficient buildings with smart ventilation systems, heat-reflective glass, and water recycling technologies.\nConstructing buildings that meet green certifications such as LEED and EDGE, which enhance property value and attract ESG-conscious investors.\n\n## 4. Waste Management and the Circular Economy\nThe circular economy is a vital aspect of sustainable technology, aiming to reduce waste and maximize resource efficiency. This concept promotes reuse, recycling, and extending the lifespan of products to minimize environmental impact.\n\nFor example, retail businesses can reduce plastic waste by adopting biodegradable packaging, while restaurants can convert food waste into organic fertilizers or bioenergy. Not only does this help lower waste disposal costs, but it also creates new revenue streams through sustainable business models.\n\n## 5. Sustainable Transportation Systems\nThe transportation sector is a major source of carbon emissions, making sustainable transportation a critical solution for reducing pollution. Key advancements include:\n\nElectric Vehicles (EVs): Cutting dependence on fossil fuels and lowering air pollution.\nSmart Public Transit Systems: Implementing clean-energy trains and buses to reduce road congestion.\nGreen Logistics Solutions: Using AI-driven route optimization to improve efficiency and reduce fuel consumption.\n\n\n\n## Case Studies: Businesses Leading the Green Technology Revolution\n\n## Tesla\u2019s Clean Energy Innovation\nTesla is not only a leader in the electric vehicle market but also a pioneer in clean energy solutions. The company has introduced innovations such as the Powerwall energy storage system for homes and Solar Roof technology, which allows homeowners to generate and store their own renewable energy. Tesla\u2019s approach highlights the future of industries powered entirely by sustainable energy.\n\n## Patagonia\u2019s Commitment to Sustainability\nPatagonia is a fashion brand dedicated to sustainability, using recycled and organic materials in its apparel production. Through its \"Worn Wear\" initiative, the company encourages customers to extend the life of their clothing, reducing waste in the fashion industry. Patagonia also invests in clean energy solutions and conservation efforts, setting an example for environmentally responsible businesses.\n\u00a0\nAdopting ESG principles not only helps businesses lower costs and improve operational efficiency but also strengthens their brand image among consumers and investors. By leveraging green technology solutions, companies can transition towards a more responsible and profitable future while minimizing their environmental impact.\n\nUltimately, integrating clean energy solutions, environmental technology, and sustainable technology into business operations is the first step toward achieving true sustainability."}]}

The more an event can impress attendees to the point where they feel like they \u201cdon\u2019t want to leave,\u201d the clearer the signal that the brand has delivered a quality experience.\n\nThis kind of success doesn\u2019t happen by chance. It\u2019s the result of intentional planning, design, and meticulous attention to every detail of the event experience\u2014anchored in what\u2019s known as a **sensory experience**. Here\u2019s how leveraging all seven senses can turn attendees into loyal brand advocates who keep coming back for more.\n\n\n\n# **What Is a Sensory Experience?**\n\n**A sensory experience refers to a marketing approach that engages the human senses\u2014sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, as well as emotional and spiritual dimensions. **By appealing to these senses, brands create immersive environments that foster deep emotional engagement and personal connection.\n\nBrands that master the art of crafting sensory experiences don\u2019t just make an impression\u2014they embed themselves in memory. It\u2019s not just about awareness; it\u2019s about emotion and attachment. This depth of connection is what fuels long-term brand loyalty and drives organic word of mouth.\n\n# **7 Sensory Experience Techniques for Designing Unforgettable Event Experiences**\n\n## **1. Stimulate Sight**\n\"Attract from the first glance with a design that reflects your brand identity.\"\nVisual presentation is the gateway to your brand\u2019s universe. Elements like spatial design, lighting, brand colors, logos, and stage visuals should clearly reflect the brand image. Using brand-consistent color palettes, lighting that complements the mood, and Instagram-worthy photo spots can organically boost online sharing and visibility.\u00a0\n\n## **2. Engage Taste**\n\"A great taste lingers longer than any words.\"\nFood and beverages aren\u2019t just refreshments\u2014they\u2019re storytelling tools. Curate menus that align with your event\u2019s theme, incorporate local flavors to set the scene, or even develop signature drinks and treats that reflect your brand identity. Each bite becomes an extension of your brand narrative.\u00a0\n\n## **3. Evoke Memory Through Smell**\n\"Scent is the most powerful trigger of memory.\"\nScents have a surprising influence on mood and memory. Pleasant aromas throughout your event space can induce calmness, luxury, or energy. Align your fragrance strategy with the event theme\u2014for example, lavender for wellness events or citrus scents for energizing environments.\u00a0\n\n## **4. Enliven the Atmosphere with Sound**\n\"The right sound sets the right mood.\"\nFrom playlists to ambient noise to human chatter, sound shapes the entire event experience. Choose music that fits the theme, add natural sounds like flowing water or birds for relaxation zones, or create custom sound design for product reveals. Every sound element should contribute to the overall sensory experience.\u00a0\n\n## **5. Activate Touch**\n\"Tactile experiences create lasting impressions.\"\nTouch adds a tangible dimension to your brand. Use textured materials in decor, offer hands-on product demos, or provide custom-designed giveaways. DIY or workshop zones are also effective, encouraging attendees to engage physically and emotionally with your brand.\u00a0\n\n## **6. Tap into Emotion**\n\"When the heart feels, the brand stays.\"\nEmotional engagement transforms experiences. Encourage attendees to share personal stories, use uplifting or inspiring content, or tell your brand\u2019s story through short films. Emotionally charged moments\u2014pride, joy, inspiration\u2014convert passive guests into brand advocates.\u00a0\n\n## **7. Add Meaning Through Spirit**\n\"Brands with purpose make a deeper impact.\"\u00a0\nTrue impact comes when experiences reflect the brand\u2019s deeper values and mission. Include social impact initiatives, tie into environmental or cultural causes, or create space for guests to share dreams and beliefs. Let every moment mean more than just \u201cfun\u201d\u2014make it meaningful.\n\n\n\n## **Case Study: Brands That Successfully Used Sensory Experience to Win Over Audiences**\n\nIncorporating the sensory experience model in event planning doesn\u2019t just create fleeting impressions. It can shift consumer behavior, boost conversions, and build lasting brand recognition. Here are two success stories that prove its effectiveness:\n\n## **Traveloka: Engaging Travelers with Limited Space**\nAs the travel industry began recovering post-COVID-19, regional platform Traveloka sought to reignite interest among travelers. With just a 30-square-meter booth in a high-traffic Bangkok mall, they partnered with Jenosize to run an activation campaign. Activities included mini-games, discount giveaways, and celebrity photo ops\u2014maximizing impact within tight spatial constraints.\n\n### **Results:**\n\nOver 200 attendees per day during the 3-day event\nSignificant lift in brand recall and online deal redemptions\n\n### **MRT Purple Line: Redefining Public Perception**\nDuring the launch of Bangkok\u2019s MRT Purple Line, the brand aimed to create a positive image despite fare concerns. Using both online and offline event strategies focused on sensory experiences, they successfully shifted customer perception.\n\n### **Results:**\n\nRebranded as \u201cA New Year\u2019s Gift\u201d for commuters\n70% increase in ridership during the campaign\nPassengers began recognizing the long-term value and quality of the service\n\nIn a world where brands compete through experience rather than advertising, creating events that make attendees \u201cnever want to leave\u201d becomes a competitive advantage.

However, there is a fascinating marketing phenomenon that explains the opposite of what should be happening. This is known as the **\"lipstick effect\" **theory, which describes the tendency of consumers to continue purchasing small luxury items even during poor economic conditions.\n\n\n\n# What is the Lipstick Effect?\n\nThe lipstick effect is an economic theory that explains consumer behavior during economic downturns. It observes that consumers, especially women, tend to continue buying affordable luxury items such as lipstick, cosmetics, accessories, etc., even when they have to economize in other areas. This phenomenon demonstrates that even during tough economic times, people still desire small pleasures and positive feelings from purchasing items that make them feel better about themselves.\n\u00a0\n# The History of the Lipstick Effect\n\nThe concept of the lipstick effect was first introduced by Leonard Lauder, the chairman of Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, in 2001. He observed that the company's lipstick sales increased significantly after the 9/11 events, a period when the U.S. economy was facing difficulties. Subsequently, this concept gained widespread attention and was subjected to in-depth studies by economists and marketers worldwide.\n\nHowever, a similar phenomenon had been observed even earlier. During the Great Depression in the 1930s, lipstick sales also increased surprisingly. This demonstrates that the phenomenon is rooted in deep-seated human behavior and has recurred throughout history.\n\u00a0\n# Reasons Behind the Lipstick Effect\n\n## Need for Confidence\nDuring times of economic uncertainty, people often feel insecure and seek ways to boost their confidence. The solution lies in purchasing affordable cosmetics or beauty products, as these can help elevate self-worth and increase confidence without spending as much as on larger luxury items.\n\n## Changing Spending Patterns\nWhen the economy is poor, consumers tend to reduce spending on large, expensive items such as houses or cars. As a result, they turn to small luxuries for happiness, as these provide a sense of fulfillment without requiring significant expenditure.\n\n## Increased Emotional Value\nDuring difficult times, small items like lipstick or perfume may have a greater emotional impact. They help consumers feel better when facing stress from economic uncertainty. Purchasing these items is like giving oneself a reward at an affordable price.\n\n## Social Mimicry\nEven in tough economic times, people still want to maintain their social image. Therefore, buying affordable beauty or fashion items allows them to feel part of social trends and fashion without overspending.\n\n## The Impact of the Lipstick Effect on Economy and Business\n\n## Business Adaptation\nCompanies, especially in the beauty and fashion industries, often adjust their marketing strategies to respond to the lipstick effect. They may focus on producing smaller or more affordable items to attract consumers seeking small pleasures during economic downturns.\n\n## Business Risk Diversification\nCompanies with diverse product lines may leverage the lipstick effect by emphasizing the marketing of more affordable products to compensate for declining sales of expensive items.\n\n## Creation of New Business Opportunities\nThe lipstick effect may lead to the emergence of new businesses that focus on producing small luxury items or affordable luxuries to meet consumer demands during economic recessions.\n\n## Maintaining Economic Stability\nAlthough small in scale, the lipstick effect can help maintain money circulation in the economic system, potentially alleviating some impacts of economic recession.\n\n## Long-term Changes in Consumer Behavior\nThe lipstick effect may result in long-term changes in consumer behavior, with consumers tending to place more importance on the value and cost-effectiveness of products, even after the economy recovers.\n\n\n\n## Examples of the Lipstick Effect in Thailand\n\n\n**During periods of economic difficulty in Thailand**, such as after the Tom Yum Kung crisis in 1997 or during the economic slowdown from 2017-2019, it was observed that female consumers showed increased interest in beauty products. According to a 2017 report by Kasikorn Research Center, the value of the cosmetics market in Thailand continued to grow by 6.5%, amounting to 168 billion baht. The facial product group, including lipsticks, had a high growth rate of 8%.\n\n\n**During the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand**, which severely impacted the economy, many consumers chose to invest in skincare products for face and body, even while being more cautious about spending in other areas. Data from Euromonitor International reported that in 2020, the skincare product market in Thailand was valued at 47,700 million baht, growing 1.8% from the previous year, despite the overall economy contracting by 6.1%.\n\u00a0\nThe lipstick effect is considered an interesting and important phenomenon in economics and marketing. Although it occurs during economic downturns, it demonstrates that consumers still desire small luxury items that can make them feel better. Understanding this phenomenon helps businesses adjust their marketing strategies and operations to align with consumer behavior in uncertain economic conditions. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of happiness and confidence in consumers' lives, which should not be overlooked even during economic recessions."}]}

This trend impacts healthcare systems, social security, and the demand for products and services related to elderly care, such as tourism, residential facilities, and various amenities. This trend requires attention from modern businesses.\n\n### 6. Digital Lifestyle\n\nDigital technology plays an increasingly significant role in daily life, transforming various aspects such as work, education, shopping, and services onto online platforms. This necessitates businesses to adapt and develop digital channels to provide convenience and meet customer demands, remaining competitive in the digital age.\n\n### 7. Industry 5.0: Human-AI Collaboration\n\nAI technology is increasingly integrated into industries to enhance efficiency in production and services. This requires both employees to adapt their skills to work alongside AI systems and businesses to invest in AI to elevate their production standards, meeting the demands of digital consumers.\n\nIt can be said that megatrends 2024 acts as a compass, guiding businesses towards a smoother path to the future.

This leads to wasted time on non-essential tasks and missed opportunities for innovation. Effective time management is a crucial skill that allows professionals to focus on high-value tasks and achieve the best possible outcomes.\n\nDiscover 6 proven time management techniques that can help increase work efficiency. If you're ready to transform your work habits and enhance productivity, let's get started!\n\n\n\n# 6 Time Management Techniques to Increase Work Efficiency\n\n## 1. Eisenhower Matrix: Prioritizing Tasks Effectively\n\nThe Eisenhower Matrix is a time management technique developed by Dwight D. Eisenhower, the former President of the United States. This method helps professionals and business leaders categorize tasks based on urgency and importance, allowing them to manage multiple responsibilities effectively.\n\nTasks are divided into 4 categories:\n\n**Important and Urgent (Q1): **Critical tasks that require immediate attention, such as emergencies or approaching deadlines.\n**Important but Not Urgent (Q2): **Strategic planning, long-term projects, and personal development.\n**Not Important but Urgent (Q3): **Meetings, requests from others, and tasks that can be delegated.\n**Not Important and Not Urgent (Q4): **Time-wasting activities like excessive social media use without purpose.\n\nTo maximize efficiency with the Eisenhower Matrix, focus primarily on Q2 tasks, as they provide long-term value and reduce future urgent crises (Q1). Delegate Q3 tasks whenever possible and minimize or eliminate Q4 tasks.\n\n## 2. The 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle): Focus on High-Impact Tasks\n\nThe Pareto Principle, or 80/20 rule, states that 80% of results come from just 20% of efforts. When applied to time management, this means that a small portion of tasks contribute to the majority of success.\n\nTo apply the Pareto Principle effectively:\n\nAnalyze all tasks and identify which ones yield the highest impact.\nPrioritize and allocate time to the most impactful tasks.\nReduce or eliminate low-value tasks that consume time without significant returns.\n\n## 3. The 1-3-5 Method: Structuring Daily Priorities\n\n The 1-3-5 Method is a simple yet one of highly effective time management techniques that helps professionals balance their workload and avoid feeling overwhelmed. This method ensures a sense of accomplishment while maintaining realistic daily goals.\n\nEach day, focus on:\n\n**1 major task \u2013 **A high-priority task that requires significant time and effort.\n**3 medium tasks \u2013** Important tasks that need attention but are not as demanding.\n**5 small tasks \u2013 **Quick, necessary tasks that can be completed efficiently.\n\nBusiness leaders can adapt this approach by planning their workload in advance at the beginning of each week for better clarity and focus.\n\n\n\n## 4. Eat Your Frog: Tackling the Toughest Task First\n\nThe \"Eat Your Frog\" method, inspired by Brian Tracy\u2019s book and Mark Twain\u2019s famous quote, encourages professionals to complete their most challenging task first thing in the morning. The rationale is that once the hardest task is done, the rest of the day will feel much easier.\n\nYour \"frog\" refers to tasks that are:\n\nThe most difficult\nThe most tedious\nThe most important\nOften procrastinated\n\nThis technique is particularly useful for entrepreneurs handling high-stakes negotiations, critical decision-making, or complex problem-solving.\n\n## 5. Deep Work: Maximizing Productivity with Focused Work Sessions\n\nCal Newport\u2019s Deep Work concept emphasizes the importance of focused, distraction-free work to enhance productivity and creativity. This method is ideal for strategic planning, innovation, and problem-solving.\n\nTo implement Deep Work:\n\nSet dedicated time blocks (at least 1-2 hours) for deep work.\nEliminate distractions by turning off notifications, phones, and emails.\nChoose a suitable work environment that fosters concentration.\nDefine clear goals for each deep work session.\n\nResearch by Gerald Weinberg shows that multitasking can reduce work efficiency by up to 80%. Establishing \"no-interruption zones\" in your workplace can significantly boost productivity.\n\n## 6. The Pomodoro Technique: Working in Time Blocks\n\nDeveloped by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, the Pomodoro Technique is one of the time management skills that enhances focus and reduces mental fatigue by breaking work into short, structured intervals.\n\nHow to increase work efficiency by the Pomodoro Technique:\n\nSet a 25-minute timer and work intensely without distractions.\nTake a 5-minute break after each Pomodoro session.\n\nThis technique fosters a sense of urgency, improving focus and efficiency while preventing burnout.\n\u00a0\n\nEffective time management skills are a key driver of productivity and success. These 6 techniques offer flexible strategies to help you work smarter, whether managing personal projects or leading a team. The key is to select the method that aligns best with your work style and responsibilities. By refining your approach to time management, you can reduce stress, enhance efficiency, and unlock greater opportunities for success.\n\nHowever, if you find time management challenging or need a more structured system, a business consulting company can provide customized strategies to optimize time management for your organization. Investing in the right approach today can lead to a more productive and fulfilling work life."}]}

However, with stricter antitrust laws, large businesses began to break apart, giving rise to the oligopoly market\u2014where only a few sellers dominate.\u00a0\n\nMany people might think that having only a few competitors means more business opportunities, but in reality, the opposite is true! When the market is divided among just a few major players, competition intensifies significantly, with enormous budgets, complex strategies, and endless investments in innovation.\n\n\n\n# Let\u2019s first understand: What is an Oligopoly Market?\n\n**An oligopoly market, or a ma****rket with few sellers, is a market structure dominated by only a small number of large companies. **Typically, there are at least two players but no more than ten. Each company holds a significant market share, so the decisions and business strategies of each player have a considerable impact on the overall market.\n\nAnother key characteristic of an oligopoly market is that each company often has some power to set prices and control production levels. However, they cannot make these decisions entirely on their own, as they must consider potential reactions from other competitors. Additionally, entering an oligopoly market in Thailand can be challenging due to several obstacles, including high capital investment requirements, the need for specialized technology or expertise, and regulatory constraints or licensing requirements.\n\u00a0\n## Interesting Examples of Oligopoly Markets in Thailand and the Challenges Each Industry Faces\n\nIn Thailand, there are several industries with an oligopoly market structure, where only a few major players dominate the market. Each of these industries faces unique challenges and competition. Here are some examples of oligopoly markets:\n\n## Thai Beer Market\nThe Thai beer market is a clear example of an oligopoly, with only a few key players, led by Boon Rawd Brewery (Singha) and Thai Beverage (Chang), which together control over 90% of the market share. A major challenge in this industry is the strict legal regulations, including advertising restrictions, production permits, and distribution laws, making it nearly impossible for new entrants to break into the market.\n\n## Airline Industry\nThe airline market in Thailand is also oligopolistic, with a few major players like Thai Airways, Thai AirAsia, Nok Air, and Thai Lion Air competing intensely. The challenges they face include high operating costs, such as fuel prices, aircraft maintenance, and fleet investments. Additionally, external factors like the COVID-19 crisis have had a severe impact on the aviation industry.\n\n\n\n## E-Commerce Platforms\nAlthough relatively new, the e-commerce market in Thailand also shows oligopoly characteristics. Major players like Shopee, Lazada, and JD Central dominate the competition. The main challenges in this industry include massive investments in logistics infrastructure, high marketing costs, building consumer trust, and retaining customers in the face of fierce competition.\n\n\n\n## Mobile Telecommunications Market\nThe telecommunications market in Thailand is controlled by three major providers: AIS, DTAC, and TRUE. Each of these companies must invest heavily in infrastructure, including signal towers, frequency auctions, and the development of 5G technology. Major challenges include intense price competition, maintaining service quality, and generating additional revenue from digital services.\n\n## Food Delivery Apps\nThe food delivery app market in Thailand is dominated by Grab, foodpanda, and LINE MAN, which compete fiercely with each other. The challenges in this industry involve balancing revenue and costs, maintaining service quality, managing riders, and competing with high-cost promotions. Moreover, continuous technological development is necessary to enhance service efficiency.\n\n## Why Do Businesses in an Oligopoly Market Have to Invest More Than Expected?\n\nMany people might think that doing business in an oligopoly market (with few sellers) is easier than in a competitive market. However, the reality is quite the opposite. The oligopoly market comes with both advantages and disadvantages. Let's explore why this is the case:\n\n## High Barriers to Entry\nThe reason there are only a few sellers in an oligopoly market is not that no one wants to enter, but because there are many obstacles to entry. Some of these include:\n\n\n**Massive Initial Investment: **For example, in the telecommunications business, companies need to invest in networks, signal towers, and frequency auctions, which can cost billions of baht.\n**Continuous Investment in Technology and Innovation: **Businesses must constantly invest in technology development, such as the 5G rollout in telecommunications or platform development in e-commerce.\n**Regulatory Requirements: **Companies must secure licenses, pass standard inspections, and comply with strict regulations. This process involves both time and money.\n\n## Intense Competition\nAlthough there are few players in the market, the competition in an oligopoly market is often fiercer than in typical markets because:\n\n\n**Intense Marketing Competition: **Businesses must allocate enormous budgets for advertising and promotions. For example, food delivery platforms continuously offer discounts and promotions to stay competitive.\n**Constant Product and Service Development: **Companies must always invest in developing new products and services to maintain a competitive edge.\n**Market Share Maintenance: **As market share increases, companies must invest more resources to retain their customer base.\n\n## Higher Consumer Expectations Than in Competitive Markets\nBeing a major player in the market means dealing with higher consumer expectations, including:\n\n\n**Service Standards:** Consumers expect premium services, such as in the airline industry, where safety and high-level customer service standards must be maintained at all times.\n**Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): **Companies need to invest in CSR activities and build a positive corporate image.\n**Crisis Management: **When issues arise, consumers expect quick and effective resolutions, such as when a bank's system crashes or mobile signals are disrupted.\n\u00a0\nBeing a player in an oligopoly market may seem advantageous due to having fewer competitors, but in reality, such markets come with both pros and cons. Companies must invest more resources and effort than many might think to maintain their leadership and meet the ever-increasing consumer expectations.\n\nSo, the answer to the question, \"Is it easier to sell when there are fewer competitors?\" is clearly \"No.\" The true challenge does not lie in the number of competitors, but in the scale of investment required and the high expectations of the market."}]}

The pandemic has forced organizations to adapt and find new ways of working. One of the concepts that has gained immense popularity is **\"Hybrid Working,\"** which involves alternating between work in the office and work from home. Even today, many organizations continue to adhere to this work model, and new-generation employees are increasingly seeking work-from-home jobs. Many have discovered that the combination of working from home and going to the office better enhances their work-life balance compared to going to the office every day, while also saving costs in various areas.\n\nTherefore, the question arises: Is hybrid work model the standard for modern work? And why should organizations adapt to the new normal by changing their work models? Let's \n\n\n\n# What is Hybrid Working?\n**Hybrid working is a work model that allows employees to alternate between work in the office and work from home (or ot****her locations) as appropriate. **This concept combines the advantages of working in the office and remote work, focusing on flexibility and productivity.\n\nIn a hybrid working setup, employees may have a predetermined schedule specifying office days and work-from-home days or have the freedom to choose their work locations based on the needs of their tasks and personal preferences. This depends on the organization's policies and the nature of each position.\n\u00a0\n# The Benefits of Hybrid Working That Appeal to New-generation Employees\n\n## Improved time and personal life management\nThe hybrid work model enables employees to effectively balance their work and personal lives. The freedom to choose where to work helps reduce stress from commuting and increases time for family or hobbies, leading to an overall improvement in quality of life and higher job satisfaction.\n\n## Cost savings\nWork from home on certain days allows employees to save significantly on expenses, especially commuting and food costs, which can be high for those working in large cities. Additionally, it reduces expenses related to dressing for office work.\n\n## Increased efficiency and creativity\nHybrid working provides employees with the opportunity to select work environments that suit them and the nature of their tasks each day, enabling better focus on their work and stimulating creativity and innovation.\n\n## Reduced fatigue from commuting\nFor employees who live far from the office, reducing the number of days spent commuting significantly alleviates fatigue and stress from traffic congestion, allowing them to have more energy and motivation for their work.\n\u00a0\n## Reasons Why Organizations Should Adopt Hybrid Working\n\n## To attract and retain talented personnel\nCompanies are currently competing to attract highly skilled personnel. Offering a hybrid work model serves as a key selling point for organizations, especially among new-generation workers who prioritize flexibility. Furthermore, it helps organizations retain talented employees longer since they experience higher job satisfaction.\n\n## To promote a modern organizational image\nImplementing hybrid working demonstrates that an organization is modern, understands employee needs, and values work-life balance, which enhances its public image and attracts quality clients and employees.\n\n## To improve efficiency and reduce costs\nHybrid working enables organizations to lower expenses related to space and utilities, as it is not necessary to have workspace for every employee simultaneously. It also enhances overall work efficiency, as employees are more satisfied and motivated.\n\n## To prepare for change\nThe work environment is rapidly changing. Adopting hybrid working allows organizations to remain flexible and ready to handle unforeseen situations, such as pandemics or natural disasters that may impact office work.\n\n## To expand recruitment opportunities\nHybrid working opens opportunities for organizations to hire talented employees from around the world, not limited to those in close proximity to the office, leading to a broader and higher-quality recruitment pool.\n\n\n\n## Future Trends of Hybrid Working\nAccording to surveys and predictions from experts, there is a clear trend that work-from-home jobs will become an increasingly prevalent work model in the future, supported by the following factors:\n\n## Hybrid workplace is gaining acceptance from leading organizations\nMajor companies in the technology sector, such as Microsoft, Google, and Salesforce, have officially announced permanent hybrid working policies. This trend is likely to encourage other organizations to consider adopting this model as well.\n\n## Becoming a basic requirement for new-generation workers\nMillennials and Gen Z, who will become the primary workforce in the future, place great importance on flexibility and work-life balance. As a result, hybrid work is the model that best meets their needs.\n\n## Changes in urban structure\nHybrid working may lead to a more dispersed distribution of housing and workplaces, reducing congestion in large cities and stimulating the economy in suburban areas or smaller towns.\n\n## Increased emphasis on health and well-being\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic, people are placing greater importance on health and well-being. Hybrid working addresses this need by reducing the risk of disease transmission and enhancing employees' quality of life.\n\u00a0\nIn summary, the hybrid work model is likely to become a standard for modern work. Despite some challenges, the benefits in terms of flexibility, productivity, and employee quality of life make this work model increasingly desirable. However, organizations must remember to plan carefully, invest in appropriate technology, and foster a corporate culture that supports flexible working to prepare for the transition into a new era of work that may change irreversibly."}]}

But the real question is: how do you design an event that\u2019s truly unforgettable? One proven approach adopted by leading global agencies and organizations is event design thinking\u2014a human-centered design process that puts the event attendee at the core, focusing on emotional engagement, sensory experience, and business goals.\n\n\n\n# **What Is Event Design Thinking ?**\n\n**Event design thinking is a strategic planning method that begins with understanding the needs and motivations of event attendees.** From there, it moves through a structured process\u2014defining challenges, developing creative ideas, building prototypes, and testing\u2014to craft a memorable and impactful experience design for events.\n\nThis approach is particularly valuable in corporate, government, or SME settings, where competition to create meaningful event experiences is more intense than ever.\n\u00a0\n# **The 5-Step Event Design Thinking Process**\n\nTo ensure the event design aligns deeply with the attendee experience, the event design thinking process follows five key steps:\u00a0\n\n## **1. Empathize \u2013 Deeply Understand Your Attendees**\nEmpathy is about stepping into your attendees' shoes\u2014not just considering demographics, but diving into behaviors, expectations, emotions, and potential pain points.\n\nFor example, if the event is a government seminar, recognizing that civil servants seek in-depth knowledge and prefer not to waste time on unrelated activities can help design sessions that are both purposeful and budget-friendly.\n\n## **2. Define \u2013 Clarify the Challenge**\nAfter gaining insight, the next step is identifying a clear design challenge that blends attendee needs with organizational objectives. For example: How can you promote local products in a way that appeals to younger generations and encourages social sharing? A focused brief ensures that everyone on the team is aligned and avoids scope creep.\n\n## **3. Ideate \u2013 Brainstorm Creative Concepts**\nWith a clear goal in place, the team can brainstorm innovative ideas that break traditional molds. Think interactive experiences or hybrid event formats. Use brainstorming tools like mind maps or include stakeholders and users in the idea generation process to ensure diverse perspectives.\u00a0\n\n## **4. Prototype \u2013 Simulate the Experience**\nPrototyping allows you to visualize and test key components of your event design before launch. This may include mapping the attendee flow, simulating interactive booths, or running a pilot workshop. These simulations reveal friction points and help optimize the event before the real day.\u00a0\n\n## **5. Test & Refine \u2013 Gather Feedback and Improve**\nThe final stage involves collecting feedback from internal teams and stakeholders using surveys, interviews, or prototype testing. Define KPIs like registration numbers, engagement rates, or Net Promoter Scores (NPS) to measure effectiveness. Even small comments can reveal hidden issues that significantly improve the final experience.\n\n\n\n## **Case Study: Jenosize & the DEmark Award Event**\n\nA strong example of applied event design thinking is the **DEmark Award (Design Excellence Award)**, organized by Thailand\u2019s Department of International Trade Promotion. The goal is to elevate Thai product design and innovation for the global market.\n\nJenosize has proudly managed the event for 8 consecutive years. Every aspect of the event design reflects event design thinking principles\u2014from stakeholder empathy to tools that support engagement and custom technologies to streamline participation.\n\n## **How the DEmark Award Reflects Event Design Thinking**\n\n**Empathize: **Understand the behavior and expectations of both participants and judges\n**Define: **Set a clear goal\u2014not just to hold a competition but to inspire innovation and elevate Thai product design\n**Ideate:** Integrate new ideas like real-time data sharing and interactive elements\n**Prototype: **Test judging technologies like iPads before official use to improve decision-making\n**Refine: **Continuously improve the event experience\u2014growing participation each year, reaching a record of 650+ entries in the latest edition\n\nJenosize\u2019s involvement in DEmark demonstrates not only professional execution, but also a deep understanding of experience design for events, which is the heart of event design thinking.\n\n## **Design Impactful Event Experiences with Event Design Thinking**\n\nEvent success isn\u2019t just about the spectacle\u2014it\u2019s about the feelings and memories created. Event design thinking turns ordinary gatherings into purpose-driven, emotionally resonant experiences.\n\nIf your organization is planning an event that aims to deliver both results and experience, Jenosize\u2014Thailand\u2019s leading event agency\u2014is your trusted partner.

Generative AI as Both a Golden Opportunity and Risk for Business\nGenerative AI is rapidly revolutionizing technology and business sectors and will become one of the most significant megatrends in 2025. This innovation will bring both opportunities and challenges to organizations. On one hand, it can enhance efficiency, spark new ideas, and create unprecedented business opportunities, such as high-quality content creation in record time, big data analysis for insights, and the development of products and services that better meet customer needs. However, it also presents risks, including data security concerns, copyright issues, and potential impacts on the labor market. Businesses must develop strategies to leverage Generative AI ethically and responsibly, preparing for possible shifts in workforce dynamics.\n\n## 2. Climate Action as an Urgent Mission, Driving Businesses Toward Sustainability\nClimate change has intensified, making it an urgent mission for all sectors, especially businesses, to adopt more sustainable models. This shift is not only a social responsibility but also a business opportunity. Companies need to invest in clean technology, develop eco-friendly products, improve production efficiency, and set clear greenhouse gas reduction targets, all of which are becoming standard for businesses of all sizes.\n\n## 3. Rising Inflation: Impact on Costs, Consumer Spending Power, and Monetary Policy\nAnother megatrend for 2025 is inflation, which is expected to have wide-reaching impacts on the economy, increasing production costs, reducing consumer purchasing power, and influencing central bank policies. To cope, businesses will need to refine cost management strategies, create flexible supply chains, and develop products that meet consumer needs in times of decreased purchasing power. Staying informed on economic and financial policies is crucial for long-term business planning.\n\n## 4. Demographic Shifts: Preparing for a Multi-Generational Society\nDemographic changes are leading to a new megatrend\u2014a more age-diverse society. While some countries are becoming aging societies, others still have large youth populations. These shifts will significantly impact the labor market, social welfare, and consumption patterns. Businesses should develop products and services that cater to all age groups, create inclusive workplaces for multiple generations, and innovate in health and eldercare technologies, tapping into important business opportunities.\n\n## 5. Rapid Technological Advancements\nTechnologies like AI, IoT, 5G, Quantum Computing, and Biotechnology are transforming all areas of society and the economy, creating new opportunities for innovation, efficiency, and solutions to global challenges. Organizations need to closely monitor tech advancements, invest in relevant technologies, and build digital skills within their teams while fostering a culture of innovation.\n\n## 6. Shift in Global Economic Power with Greater Roles for Asian Countries\nAsian countries, particularly China and India, are playing increasingly influential roles on the global economic stage, impacting trade, investment, and consumption patterns worldwide. Businesses must adapt their strategies to leverage opportunities and address challenges from this megatrend. Understanding the culture, consumer behavior, and legal frameworks in Asian markets can increase chances of success. Building partnerships with regional companies is also a key strategy for expanding markets and accessing new innovations.\n\n## 7. Rapid Urbanization: Economic Opportunities and Innovation, but with Challenges\nMajor cities are becoming hubs for innovation, job creation, and economic growth, yet they also face resource management, pollution, and social inequality challenges. Businesses should adapt to meet urban consumer needs by developing smart city solutions and supporting sustainable urban initiatives, including investments in sustainable infrastructure, clean technology, and efficient public transportation systems.\n\n## 8. Hybrid Work as the New Norm\nHybrid work, combining remote and in-office work, will become a global megatrend in the future of work, enhancing flexibility and productivity for employees. Consequently, organizations must develop remote work-friendly technological infrastructure, foster a culture that supports hybrid work, and strengthen distributed team management skills. This will help attract and retain talented employees over the long term.\n\n\n\n## 9. Transition from Fossil Fuels to Clean and Renewable Energy: A Key Step Towards a Sustainable Future\nInvestment in solar, wind, hydrogen energy, and energy storage technologies will significantly increase, along with stricter policies on greenhouse gas emissions. Businesses must adapt by investing in clean energy technologies, improving energy efficiency, and creating eco-friendly products and services. This transition also presents new business opportunities in the production and distribution of clean energy, the development of energy infrastructure, and energy management services.\n\n## 10. Revolutionizing Transportation with Electric Vehicles, Autonomous Vehicles, and Shared Mobility\nThe development of electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, and shared mobility concepts will greatly impact the automotive industry, transportation infrastructure, and urban lifestyles.

Two of the most commonly discussed terms in business management are **\u201cOKR\u201d (Objectives and Key Results) **and **\u201cKPI\u201d (Key Performance Indicators)**. While both are used to measure success, they are fundamentally different in structure and purpose. To choose the right system, business leaders and team managers must clearly understand the difference between OKR and KPI.\n\n\n\n# **Understanding the Basics: What Is OKR and What Is KPI?**\n\n## **What is OKR?**\nOKR, or Objectives and Key Results, is a strategic goal-setting framework consisting of two core components:\n\n\nObjectives \u2013 The main goals an organization aims to achieve.\nKey Results \u2013 Specific, measurable outcomes that indicate progress toward the objectives.\n\nOKRs are often used in organizations that focus on innovation, transformation, or growth. They help align employees toward a shared direction and foster a culture of positive challenges.\n\n## **What is KPI?**\nKPI, or Key Performance Indicator, is a performance measurement tool derived from an organization's specific objectives. The main purpose of KPIs is to evaluate the results of completed activities. KPIs are suitable for measuring success at the organizational, team, or individual level and are often used in tasks that require operational accuracy and consistency.\n\u00a0\n\n## **OKR vs KPI: What\u2019s the Difference?**\n\nTo better understand the difference between OKR and KPI, the table below outlines key distinctions:\n\n\n\n## **Examples of OKRs and KPIs**\n\n## **OKR Examples (Strategic, Growth-Oriented)**\n****\n\n## **KPI Examples (Operational, Result-Based)**\n\n\n## **When to Use OKR and When to Use KPI?**\n\nChoosing between OKR vs KPI isn\u2019t about deciding which system is better \u2014 it\u2019s about aligning your performance metrics with your organization's goals and transformation stage.\n\n## **When Is OKR the Right Fit?**\n\nThe company is undergoing a business transformation or innovation phase.\nYou want to inspire motivation and challenges within teams.\nThe goals are not yet quantified but have a clear strategic direction.\nYou aim to communicate a shared vision across the entire organization.\n\n## **When Is KPI the Right Fit?**\n\nThe work processes are well-defined and require precise quality control.\nYou\u2019re evaluating the success of time-bound projects.\nYou need to assess individual performance metrics such as sales, productivity, or response time.\nYou want to monitor costs or streamline operations.\n\n\n\n## **Case Study: How Leading Companies Combine OKR and KPI Effectively**\n\nGlobal companies like Google, Intel, and Adobe are prime examples of organizations that have mastered the hybrid use of OKR and KPI. They implement a two-tiered measurement system to support both strategic and operational goals:\n\n\n**Google **uses OKRs to set company-wide direction and breaks them down into team-specific quarterly OKRs (e.g., Product, Marketing). KPIs are then used to measure each individual\u2019s performance.\n**Intel**, one of the earliest adopters of OKRs in the 1970s, uses OKRs for growth and innovation while maintaining KPIs for production quality.\n**Adobe** applies OKRs to promote learning and innovation while keeping KPIs in departments that require high operational efficiency, such as customer service and marketing.\n\nBy understanding the difference between OKR and KPI, companies can design a hybrid system that supports sustainable growth. OKRs provide the strategic vision, while KPIs track actionable, measurable results. Integrating employee engagement strategies into this framework further boosts motivation by aligning individual and organizational goals\n\nAt **Jenosize**, our team of strategic consultants is here to help your business implement OKRs and KPIs professionally and effectively.

It also requires identifying the right timing and capitalizing on emerging startup trends. Entrepreneurs who can accurately seize these opportunities may transform themselves from emerging startups into leaders in the business world, making them interesting startups to watch in the coming years.\n\nLooking ahead to startup trends in 2025, it\u2019s clear that current innovations go beyond merely producing goods and services to meet consumer demands. They focus on developing products that pave the way for a new future\u2014one that benefits consumers, the people around you, and yourself. Consulting with experts in digital consulting could be a pivotal step to help you better recognize opportunities and challenges, setting you on the path to success.\n\n\n\n# 8 Interesting Startups to Watch in 2025\n\n## 1. Government Software\nOne of the fast-growing startups in 2025 is focused on developing software for government agencies. Although it is a challenging market to enter, it offers immense potential, as demonstrated by Palantir, with a market value of $125 billion. This trend is driven by governments seeking ways to cut costs and improve efficiency, particularly through AI solutions for administrative tasks such as form filling, application reviews, and document summarization. Governments currently allocate massive budgets for these tasks, making this one of emerging startup trends to watch.\n\n## 2. Public Safety Technology\nWith growing societal concerns about safety, startups developing public safety technologies are gaining traction. A prime example is Flock Safety, whose license plate recognition cameras have helped solve 10% of reported crimes in the U.S. Another noteworthy player is Abel Police, which has reduced police report preparation time from hours to minutes, enabling officers to increase on-ground activity by 25%. Public safety innovation remains one of trending startup businesses with high growth potential.\n\n## 3. Stablecoins 2.0\nStablecoins are entering a new era of widespread adoption. According to Y Combinator, stablecoin transaction volumes now account for 20% of Mastercard's, with nearly 30% of cross-border transfers utilizing this technology. Leading financial institutions like Visa are developing platforms for banks to issue their own stablecoins. Stripe\u2019s $1 billion acquisition of stablecoin startup Bridge highlights investor enthusiasm, making stablecoin technology a clear candidate for the list of startups to watch in 2025. Opportunities in this space include platforms for businesses to manage stablecoins and tools for developers to integrate stablecoins into their systems seamlessly.\n\n## 4. LLMs for Chip Design\nThe rise of AI has driven demand for highly efficient chips, positioning chip design as a national priority in many countries. AI-powered solutions, such as OpenAI O1, have shown the potential to revolutionize science and engineering, particularly in designing ASICs and FPGAs. These AI-designed chips deliver 5-100x higher performance and consume 10-100x less power than traditional processors. This intersection of AI and hardware innovation is a groundbreaking field and a critical focus for startup trends in 2025.\n\n\n\n## 5. Fintech 2.0\nDespite challenges over the past two years, including the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and tightened regulations, Fintech startups are poised for a comeback in 2025. With new infrastructure like Stripe and stablecoin technology, starting a fintech business is now easier than ever. AI tools are transforming the financial sector, giving newer startups without legacy systems a competitive edge in creating global financial products. Key growth areas include insurance, investment banking, wealth management, and cross-border payments. This resurgence places fintech firmly among the fast-growing startups of 2025.\n\n## 6. New Space Companies\nSince SpaceX revolutionized satellite launch costs, reducing expenses by over 10x, the space industry has become more accessible. Startups can now build and launch satellites with a single round of funding, opening up possibilities akin to air travel or trucking in the future. Backed by organizations like Y Combinator, companies such as Astranis (satellite communication), Relativity Space, and Stoke are thriving. Success rates for space startups now rival or surpass those of software companies, making space exploration one of the most interesting startups to watch in this year.\n\n## 7. AI-Aided Engineering Tools\nThe engineering tools for designing physical systems, from CAD/CAM to CFD software, have seen little advancement in decades. These tools often require complex simulations, significant computational resources, and highly specialized expertise. With next-generation AI capable of understanding mathematics and physics, engineers can now design systems\u2014such as aircraft, buildings, circuits, chips, and satellites\u2014faster and more efficiently. This innovative field is reshaping engineering and is among the top trending startup businesses to monitor.\n\n## 8. One Million Jobs 2.0\nAs AI disrupts traditional roles, businesses focused on creating one million human jobs that AI cannot replace are emerging as a powerful trend. Historically, technological shifts have transformed labor markets, often leading to better work conditions and entirely new roles. Startups in this space are likely to develop tools enabling individuals to start local businesses or provide online and offline services, fostering human-centric economic opportunities. This aligns with the goal of balancing automation with sustainable job creation, making it one of emerging startup trends in 2025.\n\u00a0\nAlthough the world of startups in 2025 is filled with opportunities, it cannot be denied that challenges abound as well. If you can identify and act on emerging startup trends ahead of others, it will enable you to become a leader in this competitive arena with confidence and poise. Partnering with a digital consulting expert can be a valuable resource to help you gain a clear perspective and overcome challenges with confidence.\n\nChoose the trend that suits you and prepare to soar into a bright future that no one can stop, starting today!"}]}

In today\u2019s world where customers have endless choices, success isn\u2019t about who sells first \u2014 it\u2019s about who can make customers come back again and again.\n\nSelling on marketplaces may help you gain new customers today, but if they don\u2019t return tomorrow, your business ends up starting from scratch every day. The real question is: wouldn\u2019t it be better to have a system where every click, every order, and every referral contributes to long-term customer relationships \u2014 automatically?\n\n\n\n# **Why Relying Solely on Marketplaces Could Be Holding Back Your Brand Building Success**\n\n## **Commission Fees Up to 20\u201330%**\nOne of the biggest hidden costs of marketplace selling is the high commission and platform fees. Some platforms take as much as 30% of your total sales revenue. This significantly reduces your profit per item, leaving less to invest in product development or future branding strategies.\n\n## **No Access to Customer Data**\nA major limitation of selling on marketplaces is that you don\u2019t get direct access to customer data like emails, phone numbers, or purchasing behavior. Yet, this information is essential in the brand building process, helping you tailor communication, launch personalized campaigns, and improve customer retention.\n\n### **Limited Ability to Build Long-Term Customer Relationships**\nMarketplace sales don\u2019t align with core branding principles, as you\u2019re essentially \u201crenting space\u201d on someone else\u2019s platform. This prevents your brand from forming emotional bonds with customers or delivering the kind of personalized experience that fosters loyalty.\n\n### **Easy for Customers to Switch to Competitors**\nWithout a unique brand experience or value proposition, marketplace customers often compare solely on price. If a competitor offers a lower price, they\u2019ll easily win the sale. This is a critical risk for brands that haven\u2019t yet built strong identity or differentiation.\n\u00a0\n\n### **What Is a Loyalty Program \u2014 and Why Do Modern Businesses Need One?**\n\nIn today\u2019s competitive branding landscape, creating deep customer connections is key. One of the most effective tools in the brand building process is a loyalty program \u2014 a reward system offering points, perks, and exclusive benefits to repeat customers.\n\n### **Reduce Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC)**\nAcquiring a new customer costs up to five times more than retaining an existing one. Investing in a Loyalty Program helps encourage repeat purchases, significantly lowering your overall acquisition costs.\n\n**Increase Average Order Value (AOV)**\nWhen customers feel that \u201cthe more they buy, the more they benefit,\u201d they naturally tend to spend more. Well-designed point systems and member-only promotions incentivize larger purchases \u2014 without feeling like a hard sell.\n\n### **Boost Repeat Purchases**\nThe ultimate goal of brand building is creating a loyal customer base. A Loyalty Program keeps your brand top-of-mind, driving repeat purchases through rewards that offer both emotional and tangible value.\n\n### **Enhance Word-of-Mouth Marketing**\nHappy customers who feel valued by your brand often become advocates \u2014 sharing their experience with friends and family. This type of word-of-mouth marketing is more trustworthy than traditional ads and helps expand your customer base at a lower cost.\n\n\n\n### **EverydayCustomer: The Modern Business Solution for Brand Building**\n\nIn an age where marketplaces charge 20\u201330% commissions and limit access to customer data, building your own platform is one of smart and sustainable branding principles.\n\n**EverydayCustomer is an all-in-one platform built to help Thai SMEs shift away from marketplace dependency and toward managing their own branded storefront** \u2014 consolidating all essential business tools in one place:\n\n\n**UX-first Website Builder:** Create a seamless online storefront with inventory, coupon, and order management \u2014 no coding required.\n**Tiered & Subscription-Based Loyalty System: **Encourage repeat purchases and increase brand loyalty through customizable membership benefits and reward tiers.\n**LINE, Facebook, IG, and TikTok Integration:** Combine all your social channels into one platform, enabling seamless omnichannel commerce experiences.\n**Referral Program:** Let customers refer friends via QR codes or custom links and reward them with exclusive discounts or gifts.\n**AI-Generated SEO Content: **Save time on content creation with AI that automatically writes SEO-friendly product descriptions, promotions, and blog posts.\n**One-Page Checkout: **Simplify the buying process and increase conversion rates with a fast, user-friendly checkout experience that supports QR payments and credit cards.\n**Online\u2013Offline Customer Data Sync: **Capture customer data both in-store and online, allowing for precise marketing plans and data-driven brand building decisions.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, sales aren\u2019t just numbers on a dashboard \u2014 they\u2019re the starting point for meaningful, long-term relationships. Businesses that truly grow aren\u2019t just good at selling \u2014 they\u2019re good at understanding their customers and making them want to come back.\n\nSustainable branding doesn\u2019t come from chasing new customers every day, but from delivering great experiences to the ones you already have.
